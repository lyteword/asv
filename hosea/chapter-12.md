# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 

<sup>3</sup> In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: 

<sup>4</sup> yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us, 

<sup>5</sup> even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial name. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually. 

<sup>7</sup> He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 

<sup>8</sup> And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin. 

<sup>9</sup> But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. 

<sup>10</sup> I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. 

<sup>11</sup> Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. 

<sup>12</sup> And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. 

<sup>13</sup> And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 

<sup>14</sup> Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
