# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

<sup>2</sup> The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 

<sup>3</sup> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 

<sup>4</sup> I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them. 

<sup>5</sup> They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return to me. 

<sup>6</sup> And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 

<sup>7</sup> And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him. 

<sup>8</sup> How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together. 

<sup>9</sup> I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath. 

<sup>10</sup> They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. 

<sup>11</sup> They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah. 

<sup>12</sup> Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
