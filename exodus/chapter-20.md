# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> And God spake all these words, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 

<sup>5</sup> thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me, 

<sup>6</sup> and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

<sup>9</sup> Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; 

<sup>10</sup> but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 

<sup>11</sup> for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 

<sup>12</sup> Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou shalt not kill. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou shalt not steal. 

<sup>16</sup> Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 

<sup>17</sup> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s. 

<sup>18</sup> And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off. 

<sup>19</sup> And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 

<sup>20</sup> And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not. 

<sup>21</sup> And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. 

<sup>22</sup> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 

<sup>23</sup> Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you. 

<sup>24</sup> An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee. 

<sup>25</sup> And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 

<sup>26</sup> Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.
