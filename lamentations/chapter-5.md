# Lamentations 5 

**¹** Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach. 

**²** Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens. 

**³** We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows. 

**⁴** We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us. 

**⁵** Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest. 

**⁶** We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

**⁷** Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities. 

**⁸** Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand. 

**⁹** We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness. 

**¹⁰** Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine. 

**¹¹** They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. 

**¹²** Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored. 

**¹³** The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood. 

**¹⁴** The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music. 

**¹⁵** The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning. 

**¹⁶** The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned. 

**¹⁷** For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim; 

**¹⁸** For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it. 

**¹⁹** Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation. 

**²⁰** Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time? 

**²¹** Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old. 

**²²** But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.
