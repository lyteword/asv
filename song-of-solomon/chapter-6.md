# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee? 

<sup>2</sup> My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth his flock among the lilies. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners. 

<sup>5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead. 

<sup>6</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. 

<sup>7</sup> Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil. 

<sup>8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number. 

<sup>9</sup> My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners? 

<sup>11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower. 

<sup>12</sup> Before I was aware, my soul set me Among the chariots of my princely people. 

<sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?
