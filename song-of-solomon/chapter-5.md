# Chapter 5

**¹** I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 

**²** I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night. 

**³** I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 

**⁴** My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my heart was moved for him. 

**⁵** I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt. 

**⁶** I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. 

**⁷** The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me. 

**⁸** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love. 

**⁹** What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so adjure us? 

**¹⁰** My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand. 

**¹¹** His head is as the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, and black as a raven. 

**¹²** His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, and fitly set. 

**¹³** His cheeks are as a bed of spices, As banks of sweet herbs: His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. 

**¹⁴** His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl: His body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires. 

**¹⁵** His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. 

**¹⁶** His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
