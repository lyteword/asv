# Song Of Solomon 4 

**¹** Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead. 

**²** Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. 

**³** Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil. 

**⁴** Thy neck is like the tower of David Builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men. 

**⁵** Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies. 

**⁶** Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense. 

**⁷** Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee. 

**⁸** Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’ dens, From the mountains of the leopards. 

**⁹** Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck. 

**¹⁰** How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices! 

**¹¹** Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. 

**¹²** A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 

**¹³** Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants, 

**¹⁴** Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

**¹⁵** Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon. 

**¹⁶** Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.
