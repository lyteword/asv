# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of David Builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies. 

<sup>6</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lionsâ€™ dens, From the mountains of the leopards. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck. 

<sup>10</sup> How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices! 

<sup>11</sup> Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. 

<sup>12</sup> A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants, 

<sup>14</sup> Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon. 

<sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.
