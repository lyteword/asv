# Song Of Solomon 1 

**¹** The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s. 

**²** Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine. 

**³** Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee. 

**⁴** Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee. 

**⁵** I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon. 

**⁶** Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept. 

**⁷** Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions? 

**⁸** If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. 

**⁹** I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. 

**¹⁰** Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, Thy neck with strings of jewels. 

**¹¹** We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver. 

**¹²** While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance. 

**¹³** My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts. 

**¹⁴** My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi. 

**¹⁵** Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves. 

**¹⁶** Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green. 

**¹⁷** The beams of our house are cedars, And our rafters are firs.
