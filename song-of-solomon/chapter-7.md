# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skilful workman. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy body is like a round goblet, Wherein no mingled wine is wanting: Thy waist is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof. 

<sup>6</sup> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 

<sup>7</sup> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters. 

<sup>8</sup> I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples, 

<sup>9</sup> And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep. 

<sup>10</sup> I am my beloved’s; And his desire is toward me. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages. 

<sup>12</sup> Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, And its blossom is open, And the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love. 

<sup>13</sup> The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
