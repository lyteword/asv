# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s. 

<sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine. 

<sup>3</sup> Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee. 

<sup>4</sup> Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee. 

<sup>5</sup> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon. 

<sup>6</sup> Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept. 

<sup>7</sup> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions? 

<sup>8</sup> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. 

<sup>9</sup> I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. 

<sup>10</sup> Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, Thy neck with strings of jewels. 

<sup>11</sup> We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance. 

<sup>13</sup> My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts. 

<sup>14</sup> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves. 

<sup>16</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green. 

<sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars, And our rafters are firs.
