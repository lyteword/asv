# Joel 1 

**¹** The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. 

**²** Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? 

**³** Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. 

**⁴** That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. 

**⁵** Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. 

**⁶** For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness. 

**⁷** He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. 

**⁸** Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 

**⁹** The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn. 

**¹⁰** The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 

**¹¹** Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished. 

**¹²** The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men. 

**¹³** Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God. 

**¹⁴** Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah. 

**¹⁵** Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come. 

**¹⁶** Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? 

**¹⁷** The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered. 

**¹⁸** How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 

**¹⁹** O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. 

**²⁰** Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
