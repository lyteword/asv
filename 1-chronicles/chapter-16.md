# 1 Chronicles 16 

**¹** And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. 

**²** And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah. 

**³** And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. 

**⁴** And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel: 

**⁵** Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 

**⁶** and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God. 

**⁷** Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 

**⁸** O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples. 

**⁹** Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works. 

**¹⁰** Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. 

**¹¹** Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore. 

**¹²** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 

**¹³** O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

**¹⁴** He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth. 

**¹⁵** Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 

**¹⁶** The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac, 

**¹⁷** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant, 

**¹⁸** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; 

**¹⁹** When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it; 

**²⁰** And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people. 

**²¹** He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 

**²²** Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. 

**²³** Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day. 

**²⁴** Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. 

**²⁵** For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods. 

**²⁶** For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens. 

**²⁷** Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place. 

**²⁸** Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength; 

**²⁹** Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him; Worship Jehovah in holy array. 

**³⁰** Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved. 

**³¹** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth. 

**³²** Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein; 

**³³** Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth. 

**³⁴** O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**³⁵** And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. 

**³⁶** Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. 

**³⁷** So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required; 

**³⁸** and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; 

**³⁹** and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon, 

**⁴⁰** to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel; 

**⁴¹** and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

**⁴²** and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. 

**⁴³** And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
