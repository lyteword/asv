# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly. 

<sup>2</sup> And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, And thou heardest my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head. 

<sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God. 

<sup>7</sup> When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah. 

<sup>10</sup> And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
