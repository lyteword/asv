# Jonah 2 

**¹** Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish’s belly. 

**²** And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, And thou heardest my voice. 

**³** For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me. 

**⁴** And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 

**⁵** The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head. 

**⁶** I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God. 

**⁷** When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple. 

**⁸** They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy. 

**⁹** But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah. 

**¹⁰** And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
