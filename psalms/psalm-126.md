# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream. 

<sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them. 

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah hath done great things for us, Whereof we are glad. 

<sup>4</sup> Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South. 

<sup>5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

<sup>6</sup> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
