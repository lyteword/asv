# Psalm 126 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream. 

**²** Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them. 

**³** Jehovah hath done great things for us, Whereof we are glad. 

**⁴** Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South. 

**⁵** They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

**⁶** He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
