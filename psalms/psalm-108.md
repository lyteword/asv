# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm of David. My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. 

<sup>2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. 

<sup>3</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth reacheth unto the skies. 

<sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us. 

<sup>7</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. 

<sup>9</sup> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout. 

<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 

<sup>12</sup> Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man. 

<sup>13</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
