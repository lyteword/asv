# Psalm 34

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. 

<sup>3</sup> Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. 

<sup>4</sup> I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. 

<sup>5</sup> They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded. 

<sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles. 

<sup>7</sup> The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, And delivereth them. 

<sup>8</sup> Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him. 

<sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah. 

<sup>12</sup> What man is he that desireth life, And loveth many days, that he may see good? 

<sup>13</sup> Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile. 

<sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it. 

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are open unto their cry. 

<sup>16</sup> The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> The righteous cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles. 

<sup>18</sup> Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all. 

<sup>20</sup> He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken. 

<sup>21</sup> Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. 

<sup>22</sup> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
