# Psalm 34 

**¹** A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. 

**²** My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. 

**³** Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. 

**⁴** I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. 

**⁵** They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded. 

**⁶** This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles. 

**⁷** The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, And delivereth them. 

**⁸** Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him. 

**⁹** Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him. 

**¹⁰** The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing. 

**¹¹** Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah. 

**¹²** What man is he that desireth life, And loveth many days, that he may see good? 

**¹³** Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile. 

**¹⁴** Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it. 

**¹⁵** The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are open unto their cry. 

**¹⁶** The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 

**¹⁷** The righteous cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles. 

**¹⁸** Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit. 

**¹⁹** Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all. 

**²⁰** He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken. 

**²¹** Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. 

**²²** Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
