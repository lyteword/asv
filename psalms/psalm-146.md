# Psalm 146

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 

<sup>3</sup> Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 

<sup>4</sup> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God: 

<sup>6</sup> Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever; 

<sup>7</sup> Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners; 

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah openeth the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous; 

<sup>9</sup> Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 

<sup>10</sup> Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.
