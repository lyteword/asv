# Psalm 146

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul. 

**²** While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 

**³** Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 

**⁴** His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish. 

**⁵** Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God: 

**⁶** Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever; 

**⁷** Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners; 

**⁸** Jehovah openeth the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous; 

**⁹** Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 

**¹⁰** Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.
