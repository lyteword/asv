# Psalm 138 

**¹** A Psalm of David. I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: Before the gods will I sing praises unto thee. 

**²** I will worship toward thy holy temple, And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 

**³** In the day that I called thou answeredst me, Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul. 

**⁴** All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O Jehovah, For they have heard the words of thy mouth. 

**⁵** Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah; For great is the glory of Jehovah. 

**⁶** For though Jehovah is high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; But the haughty he knoweth from afar. 

**⁷** Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, And thy right hand will save me. 

**⁸** Jehovah will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Forsake not the works of thine own hands.
