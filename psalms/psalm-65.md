# Psalm 65

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A Song of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; And unto thee shall the vow be performed. 

<sup>2</sup> O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee shall all flesh come. 

<sup>3</sup> Iniquities prevail against me: As for our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, That he may dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, Thy holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of them that are afar off upon the sea: 

<sup>6</sup> Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains, Being girded about with might; 

<sup>7</sup> Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples. 

<sup>8</sup> They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, Thou greatly enrichest it; The river of God is full of water: Thou providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Thou waterest its furrows abundantly; Thou settlest the ridges thereof: Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou blessest the springing thereof. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; And thy paths drop fatness. 

<sup>12</sup> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy. 

<sup>13</sup> The pastures are clothed with flocks; The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they also sing.
