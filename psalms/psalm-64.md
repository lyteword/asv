# Psalm 64

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity; 

<sup>3</sup> Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words, 

<sup>4</sup> That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 

<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them? 

<sup>6</sup> They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep. 

<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head. 

<sup>9</sup> And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.
