# Psalm 92

**¹** A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High; 

**²** To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night, 

**³** With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp. 

**⁴** For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 

**⁵** How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep. 

**⁶** A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this: 

**⁷** When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever. 

**⁸** But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore. 

**⁹** For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 

**¹⁰** But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. 

**¹¹** Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. 

**¹²** The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

**¹³** They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God. 

**¹⁴** They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green: 

**¹⁵** To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
