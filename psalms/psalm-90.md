# Psalm 90 

**¹** A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations. 

**²** Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 

**³** Thou turnest man to destruction, And sayest, Return, ye children of men. 

**⁴** For a thousand years in thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night. 

**⁵** Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 

**⁶** In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 

**⁷** For we are consumed in thine anger, And in thy wrath are we troubled. 

**⁸** Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 

**⁹** For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh. 

**¹⁰** The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away. 

**¹¹** Who knoweth the power of thine anger, And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? 

**¹²** So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom. 

**¹³** Return, O Jehovah; how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 

**¹⁴** Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

**¹⁵** Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil. 

**¹⁶** Let thy work appear unto thy servants, And thy glory upon their children. 

**¹⁷** And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
