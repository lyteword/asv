# Psalm 119

<sup>1</sup> Blessed are they that are perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Jehovah. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, That seek him with the whole heart. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, they do no unrighteousness; They walk in his ways. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast commanded us thy precepts, That we should observe them diligently. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh that my ways were established To observe thy statutes! 

<sup>6</sup> Then shall I not be put to shame, When I have respect unto all thy commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> I will give thanks unto thee with uprightness of heart, When I learn thy righteous judgments. 

<sup>8</sup> I will observe thy statutes: Oh forsake me not utterly. 

<sup>9</sup> Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word. 

<sup>10</sup> With my whole heart have I sought thee: Oh let me not wander from thy commandments. 

<sup>11</sup> Thy word have I laid up in my heart, That I might not sin against thee. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed art thou, O Jehovah: Teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>13</sup> With my lips have I declared All the ordinances of thy mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, As much as in all riches. 

<sup>15</sup> I will meditate on thy precepts, And have respect unto thy ways. 

<sup>16</sup> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. 

<sup>17</sup> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live; So will I observe thy word. 

<sup>18</sup> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold Wondrous things out of thy law. 

<sup>19</sup> I am a sojourner in the earth: Hide not thy commandments from me. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul breaketh for the longing That it hath unto thine ordinances at all times. 

<sup>21</sup> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, That do wander from thy commandments. 

<sup>22</sup> Take away from me reproach and contempt; For I have kept thy testimonies. 

<sup>23</sup> Princes also sat and talked against me; But thy servant did meditate on thy statutes. 

<sup>24</sup> Thy testimonies also are my delight And my counsellors. 

<sup>25</sup> My soul cleaveth unto the dust: Quicken thou me according to thy word. 

<sup>26</sup> I declared my ways, and thou answeredst me: Teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>27</sup> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: So shall I meditate on thy wondrous works. 

<sup>28</sup> My soul melteth for heaviness: Strengthen thou me according unto thy word. 

<sup>29</sup> Remove from me the way of falsehood; And grant me thy law graciously. 

<sup>30</sup> I have chosen the way of faithfulness: Thine ordinances have I set before me. 

<sup>31</sup> I cleave unto thy testimonies: O Jehovah, put me not to shame. 

<sup>32</sup> I will run the way of thy commandments, When thou shalt enlarge my heart. 

<sup>33</sup> Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of thy statutes; And I shall keep it unto the end. 

<sup>34</sup> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. 

<sup>35</sup> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; For therein do I delight. 

<sup>36</sup> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, And not to covetousness. 

<sup>37</sup> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, And quicken me in thy ways. 

<sup>38</sup> Confirm unto thy servant thy word, Which is in order unto the fear of thee. 

<sup>39</sup> Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid; For thine ordinances are good. 

<sup>40</sup> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: Quicken me in thy righteousness. 

<sup>41</sup> Let thy lovingkindnesses also come unto me, O Jehovah, Even thy salvation, according to thy word. 

<sup>42</sup> So shall I have an answer for him that reproacheth me; For I trust in thy word. 

<sup>43</sup> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; For I have hoped in thine ordinances. 

<sup>44</sup> So shall I observe thy law continually For ever and ever. 

<sup>45</sup> And I shall walk at liberty; For I have sought thy precepts. 

<sup>46</sup> I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings, And shall not be put to shame. 

<sup>47</sup> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, Which I have loved. 

<sup>48</sup> I will lift up my hands also unto thy commandments, which I have loved; And I will meditate on thy statutes. 

<sup>49</sup> Remember the word unto thy servant, Because thou hast made me to hope. 

<sup>50</sup> This is my comfort in my affliction; For thy word hath quickened me. 

<sup>51</sup> The proud have had me greatly in derision: Yet have I not swerved from thy law. 

<sup>52</sup> I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself. 

<sup>53</sup> Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me, Because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 

<sup>54</sup> Thy statutes have been my songs In the house of my pilgrimage. 

<sup>55</sup> I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, And have observed thy law. 

<sup>56</sup> This I have had, Because I have kept thy precepts. 

<sup>57</sup> Jehovah is my portion: I have said that I would observe thy words. 

<sup>58</sup> I entreated thy favor with my whole heart: Be merciful unto me according to thy word. 

<sup>59</sup> I thought on my ways, And turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 

<sup>60</sup> I made haste, and delayed not, To observe thy commandments. 

<sup>61</sup> The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; But I have not forgotten thy law. 

<sup>62</sup> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee Because of thy righteous ordinances. 

<sup>63</sup> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, And of them that observe thy precepts. 

<sup>64</sup> The earth, O Jehovah, is full of thy lovingkindness: Teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>65</sup> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Jehovah, according unto thy word. 

<sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and knowledge; For I have believed in thy commandments. 

<sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted I went astray; But now I observe thy word. 

<sup>68</sup> Thou art good, and doest good; Teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>69</sup> The proud have forged a lie against me: With my whole heart will I keep thy precepts. 

<sup>70</sup> Their heart is as fat as grease; But I delight in thy law. 

<sup>71</sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes. 

<sup>72</sup> The law of thy mouth is better unto me Than thousands of gold and silver. 

<sup>73</sup> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 

<sup>74</sup> They that fear thee shall see me and be glad, Because I have hoped in thy word. 

<sup>75</sup> I know, O Jehovah, that thy judgments are righteous, And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me. 

<sup>76</sup> Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness be for my comfort, According to thy word unto thy servant. 

<sup>77</sup> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; For thy law is my delight. 

<sup>78</sup> Let the proud be put to shame; for they have overthrown me wrongfully: But I will meditate on thy precepts. 

<sup>79</sup> Let those that fear thee turn unto me; And they shall know thy testimonies. 

<sup>80</sup> Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes, That I be not put to shame. 

<sup>81</sup> My soul fainteth for thy salvation; But I hope in thy word. 

<sup>82</sup> Mine eyes fail for thy word, While I say, When wilt thou comfort me? 

<sup>83</sup> For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; Yet do I not forget thy statutes. 

<sup>84</sup> How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 

<sup>85</sup> The proud have digged pits for me, Who are not according to thy law. 

<sup>86</sup> All thy commandments are faithful: They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. 

<sup>87</sup> They had almost consumed me upon earth; But I forsook not thy precepts. 

<sup>88</sup> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; So shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth. 

<sup>89</sup> For ever, O Jehovah, Thy word is settled in heaven. 

<sup>90</sup> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. 

<sup>91</sup> They abide this day according to thine ordinances; For all things are thy servants. 

<sup>92</sup> Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction. 

<sup>93</sup> I will never forget thy precepts; For with them thou hast quickened me. 

<sup>94</sup> I am thine, save me; For I have sought thy precepts. 

<sup>95</sup> The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me; But I will consider thy testimonies. 

<sup>96</sup> I have seen an end of all perfection; But thy commandment is exceeding broad. 

<sup>97</sup> Oh how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day. 

<sup>98</sup> Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; For they are ever with me. 

<sup>99</sup> I have more understanding than all my teachers; For thy testimonies are my meditation. 

<sup>100</sup> I understand more than the aged, Because I have kept thy precepts. 

<sup>101</sup> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, That I might observe thy word. 

<sup>102</sup> I have not turned aside from thine ordinances; For thou hast taught me. 

<sup>103</sup> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 

<sup>104</sup> Through thy precepts I get understanding: Therefore I hate every false way. 

<sup>105</sup> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, And light unto my path. 

<sup>106</sup> I have sworn, and have confirmed it, That I will observe thy righteous ordinances. 

<sup>107</sup> I am afflicted very much: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according unto thy word. 

<sup>108</sup> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill-offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah, And teach me thine ordinances. 

<sup>109</sup> My soul is continually in my hand; Yet do I not forget thy law. 

<sup>110</sup> The wicked have laid a snare for me; Yet have I not gone astray from thy precepts. 

<sup>111</sup> Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever; For they are the rejoicing of my heart. 

<sup>112</sup> I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes For ever, even unto the end. 

<sup>113</sup> I hate them that are of a double mind; But thy law do I love. 

<sup>114</sup> Thou art my hiding-place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 

<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, ye evil-doers, That I may keep the commandments of my God. 

<sup>116</sup> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; And let me not be ashamed of my hope. 

<sup>117</sup> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe, And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually. 

<sup>118</sup> Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes; For their deceit is falsehood. 

<sup>119</sup> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: Therefore I love thy testimonies. 

<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments. 

<sup>121</sup> I have done justice and righteousness: Leave me not to mine oppressors. 

<sup>122</sup> Be surety for thy servant for good: Let not the proud oppress me. 

<sup>123</sup> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, And for thy righteous word. 

<sup>124</sup> Deal with thy servant according unto thy lovingkindness, And teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>125</sup> I am thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies. 

<sup>126</sup> It is time for Jehovah to work; For they have made void thy law. 

<sup>127</sup> Therefore I love thy commandments Above gold, yea, above fine gold. 

<sup>128</sup> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; And I hate every false way. 

<sup>129</sup> Thy testimonies are wonderful; Therefore doth my soul keep them. 

<sup>130</sup> The opening of thy words giveth light; It giveth understanding unto the simple. 

<sup>131</sup> I opened wide my mouth, and panted; For I longed for thy commandments. 

<sup>132</sup> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me, As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 

<sup>133</sup> Establish my footsteps in thy word; And let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 

<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man: So will I observe thy precepts. 

<sup>135</sup> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; And teach me thy statutes. 

<sup>136</sup> Streams of water run down mine eyes, Because they observe not thy law. 

<sup>137</sup> Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, And upright are thy judgments. 

<sup>138</sup> Thou hast commanded thy testimonies in righteousness And very faithfulness. 

<sup>139</sup> My zeal hath consumed me, Because mine adversaries have forgotten thy words. 

<sup>140</sup> Thy word is very pure; Therefore thy servant loveth it. 

<sup>141</sup> I am small and despised; Yet do I not forget thy precepts. 

<sup>142</sup> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And thy law is truth. 

<sup>143</sup> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me; Yet thy commandments are my delight. 

<sup>144</sup> Thy testimonies are righteous for ever: Give me understanding, and I shall live.

<sup>146</sup> I have called unto thee; save me, And I shall observe thy testimonies. 

<sup>147</sup> I anticipated the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy words. 

<sup>148</sup> Mine eyes anticipated the night-watches, That I might meditate on thy word. 

<sup>149</sup> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thine ordinances. 

<sup>150</sup> They draw nigh that follow after wickedness; They are far from thy law. 

<sup>151</sup> Thou art nigh, O Jehovah; And all thy commandments are truth.
