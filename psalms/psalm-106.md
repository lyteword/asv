# Psalm 106

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise? 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times. 

<sup>4</sup> Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation, 

<sup>5</sup> That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance. 

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his nameâ€™s sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known. 

<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left. 

<sup>12</sup> Then believed they his words; They sang his praise. 

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel, 

<sup>14</sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert. 

<sup>15</sup> And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul. 

<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah. 

<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image. 

<sup>20</sup> Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. 

<sup>21</sup> They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt, 

<sup>22</sup> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. 

<sup>24</sup> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word, 

<sup>25</sup> But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. 

<sup>26</sup> Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness, 

<sup>27</sup> And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands. 

<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead. 

<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them. 

<sup>30</sup> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed. 

<sup>31</sup> And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore. 

<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; 

<sup>33</sup> Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them, 

<sup>35</sup> But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works, 

<sup>36</sup> And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them. 

<sup>37</sup> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, 

<sup>38</sup> And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood. 

<sup>39</sup> Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings. 

<sup>40</sup> Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance. 

<sup>41</sup> And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand. 

<sup>43</sup> Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry: 

<sup>45</sup> And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. 

<sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive. 

<sup>47</sup> Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. 

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.
