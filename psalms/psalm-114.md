# Psalm 114 

**¹** When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 

**²** Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

**³** The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back. 

**⁴** The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs. 

**⁵** What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? 

**⁶** Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs? 

**⁷** Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob, 

**⁸** Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
