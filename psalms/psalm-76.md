# Psalm 76

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey. 

<sup>5</sup> The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands. 

<sup>6</sup> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 

<sup>8</sup> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still, 

<sup>9</sup> When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah 

<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. 

<sup>11</sup> Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 

<sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
