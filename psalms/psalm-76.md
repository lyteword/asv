# Psalm 76 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel. 

**²** In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion. 

**³** There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah 

**⁴** Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey. 

**⁵** The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands. 

**⁶** At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 

**⁷** Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 

**⁸** Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still, 

**⁹** When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah 

**¹⁰** Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. 

**¹¹** Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 

**¹²** He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
