# Psalm 16

<sup>1</sup> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I take refuge. 

<sup>2</sup> O my soul, thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee. 

<sup>3</sup> As for the saints that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight. 

<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another god: Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips. 

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot. 

<sup>6</sup> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage. 

<sup>7</sup> I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons. 

<sup>8</sup> I have set Jehovah always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: My flesh also shall dwell in safety. 

<sup>10</sup> For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
