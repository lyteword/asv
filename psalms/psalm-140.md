# Psalm 140

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man: 

<sup>2</sup> Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war. 

<sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Addersâ€™ poison is under their lips. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. 

<sup>5</sup> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God: Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah. 

<sup>7</sup> O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 

<sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise. 

<sup>11</sup> An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 

<sup>12</sup> I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
