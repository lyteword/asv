# Psalm 111

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 

**²** The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 

**³** His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever. 

**⁴** He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful. 

**⁵** He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant. 

**⁶** He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations. 

**⁷** The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure. 

**⁸** They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness. 

**⁹** He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name. 

**¹⁰** The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth for ever.
