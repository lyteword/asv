# Psalm 47 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 

**²** For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth. 

**³** He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet. 

**⁴** He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah 

**⁵** God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet. 

**⁶** Sing praises to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

**⁷** For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding. 

**⁸** God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne. 

**⁹** The princes of the peoples are gathered together To be the people of the God of Abraham; For the shields of the earth belong unto God: He is greatly exalted.
