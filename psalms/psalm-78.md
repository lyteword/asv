# Psalm 78

**¹** Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 

**²** I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old, 

**³** Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us. 

**⁴** We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done. 

**⁵** For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children; 

**⁶** That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children, 

**⁷** That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments, 

**⁸** And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 

**⁹** The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle. 

**¹⁰** They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law; 

**¹¹** And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them. 

**¹²** Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

**¹³** He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap. 

**¹⁴** In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire. 

**¹⁵** He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. 

**¹⁶** He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers. 

**¹⁷** Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert. 

**¹⁸** And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire. 

**¹⁹** Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 

**²⁰** Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people? 

**²¹** Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel; 

**²²** Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation. 

**²³** Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven; 

**²⁴** And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven. 

**²⁵** Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full. 

**²⁶** He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind. 

**²⁷** He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas: 

**²⁸** And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations. 

**²⁹** So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire. 

**³⁰** They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths, 

**³¹** When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel. 

**³²** For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works. 

**³³** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror. 

**³⁴** When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly. 

**³⁵** And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer. 

**³⁶** But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue. 

**³⁷** For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant. 

**³⁸** But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath. 

**³⁹** And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 

**⁴⁰** How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert! 

**⁴¹** And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel. 

**⁴²** They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; 

**⁴³** How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan, 

**⁴⁴** And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink. 

**⁴⁵** He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them. 

**⁴⁶** He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust. 

**⁴⁷** He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost. 

**⁴⁸** He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

**⁴⁹** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil. 

**⁵⁰** He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence, 

**⁵¹** And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. 

**⁵²** But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

**⁵³** And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

**⁵⁴** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten. 

**⁵⁵** He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

**⁵⁶** Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies; 

**⁵⁷** But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 

**⁵⁸** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 

**⁵⁹** When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel; 

**⁶⁰** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men; 

**⁶¹** And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary’s hand. 

**⁶²** He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance. 

**⁶³** Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song. 

**⁶⁴** Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation. 

**⁶⁵** Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 

**⁶⁶** And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach. 

**⁶⁷** Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim, 

**⁶⁸** But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved. 

**⁶⁹** And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever. 

**⁷⁰** He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds: 

**⁷¹** From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 

**⁷²** So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
