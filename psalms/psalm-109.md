# Psalm 109

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 

<sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause. 

<sup>4</sup> For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer. 

<sup>5</sup> And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love. 

<sup>6</sup> Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin. 

<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few; And let another take his office. 

<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow. 

<sup>10</sup> Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor. 

<sup>12</sup> Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. 

<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth; 

<sup>16</sup> Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them. 

<sup>17</sup> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. 

<sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones. 

<sup>19</sup> Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 

<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul. 

<sup>21</sup> But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me; 

<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me. 

<sup>23</sup> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. 

<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness. 

<sup>25</sup> I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head. 

<sup>26</sup> Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness: 

<sup>27</sup> That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, Jehovah, hast done it. 

<sup>28</sup> Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice. 

<sup>29</sup> Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe. 

<sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 

<sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.
