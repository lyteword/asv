# Psalm 20

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; 

<sup>2</sup> Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion; 

<sup>3</sup> Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Grant thee thy heartâ€™s desire, And fulfil all thy counsel. 

<sup>5</sup> We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions. 

<sup>6</sup> Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God. 

<sup>8</sup> They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright. 

<sup>9</sup> Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.
