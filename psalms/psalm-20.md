# Psalm 20

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; 

**²** Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion; 

**³** Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah 

**⁴** Grant thee thy heart’s desire, And fulfil all thy counsel. 

**⁵** We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions. 

**⁶** Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand. 

**⁷** Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God. 

**⁸** They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright. 

**⁹** Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.
