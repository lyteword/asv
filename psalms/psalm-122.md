# Psalm 122

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah. 

**²** Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem, 

**³** Jerusalem, that art builded As a city that is compact together; 

**⁴** Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, For an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah. 

**⁵** For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. 

**⁶** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee. 

**⁷** Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces. 

**⁸** For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 

**⁹** For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.
