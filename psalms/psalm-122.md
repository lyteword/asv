# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah. 

<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem, 

<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem, that art builded As a city that is compact together; 

<sup>4</sup> Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, For an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah. 

<sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. 

<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee. 

<sup>7</sup> Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces. 

<sup>8</sup> For my brethren and companionsâ€™ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 

<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.
