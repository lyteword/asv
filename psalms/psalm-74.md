# Psalm 74 

**¹** Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 

**²** Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 

**³** Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary. 

**⁴** Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs. 

**⁵** They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees. 

**⁶** And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers. 

**⁷** They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground. 

**⁸** They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 

**⁹** We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 

**¹⁰** How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 

**¹¹** Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them. 

**¹²** Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

**¹³** Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters. 

**¹⁴** Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 

**¹⁵** Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers. 

**¹⁶** The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 

**¹⁷** Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter. 

**¹⁸** Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name. 

**¹⁹** Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever. 

**²⁰** Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence. 

**²¹** Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name. 

**²²** Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day. 

**²³** Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
