# Psalm 72 

**¹** A Psalm of Solomon. Give the king thy judgments, O God, And thy righteousness unto the king’s son. 

**²** He will judge thy people with righteousness, And thy poor with justice. 

**³** The mountains shall bring peace to the people, And the hills, in righteousness. 

**⁴** He will judge the poor of the people, He will save the children of the needy, And will break in pieces the oppressor. 

**⁵** They shall fear thee while the sun endureth, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations. 

**⁶** He will come down like rain upon the mown grass, As showers that water the earth. 

**⁷** In his days shall the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more. 

**⁸** He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth. 

**⁹** They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; And his enemies shall lick the dust. 

**¹⁰** The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute: The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 

**¹¹** Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him. 

**¹²** For he will deliver the needy when he crieth, And the poor, that hath no helper. 

**¹³** He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save. 

**¹⁴** He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his sight: 

**¹⁵** And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: And men shall pray for him continually; They shall bless him all the day long. 

**¹⁶** There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains; The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 

**¹⁷** His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun: And men shall be blessed in him; All nations shall call him happy. 

**¹⁸** Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things: 

**¹⁹** And blessed be his glorious name for ever; And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen. 

**²⁰** The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
