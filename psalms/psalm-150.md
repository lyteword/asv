# Psalm 150

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp. 

<sup>4</sup> Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. 

<sup>5</sup> Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high sounding cymbals. 

<sup>6</sup> Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah.
