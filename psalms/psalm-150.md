**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power. 

**²** Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness. 

**³** Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp. 

**⁴** Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. 

**⁵** Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high sounding cymbals. 

**⁶** Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah.
