# Psalm 57 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until these calamities be overpast. 

**²** I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth all things for me. 

**³** He will send from heaven, and save me, When he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth. 

**⁴** My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword. 

**⁵** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth. 

**⁶** They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah 

**⁷** My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. 

**⁸** Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. 

**⁹** I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

**¹⁰** For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies. 

**¹¹** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth.
