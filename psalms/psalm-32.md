# Psalm 32 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered. 

**²** Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile. 

**³** When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long. 

**⁴** For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer. Selah 

**⁵** I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah 

**⁶** For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him. 

**⁷** Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah 

**⁸** I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. 

**⁹** Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, Else they will not come near unto thee. 

**¹⁰** Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about. 

**¹¹** Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
