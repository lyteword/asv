# Psalm 63

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is. 

<sup>2</sup> So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory. 

<sup>3</sup> Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee. 

<sup>4</sup> So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 

<sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips; 

<sup>6</sup> When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches. 

<sup>7</sup> For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 

<sup>8</sup> My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me. 

<sup>9</sup> But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes. 

<sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
