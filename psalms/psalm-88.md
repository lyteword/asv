# Psalm 88

**¹** A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee. 

**²** Let my prayer enter into thy presence; Incline thine ear unto my cry. 

**³** For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol. 

**⁴** I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help, 

**⁵** Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut off from thy hand. 

**⁶** Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps. 

**⁷** Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah 

**⁸** Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 

**⁹** Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread forth my hands unto thee. 

**¹⁰** Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah 

**¹¹** Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction? 

**¹²** Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

**¹³** But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. 

**¹⁴** Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me? 

**¹⁵** I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 

**¹⁶** Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off. 

**¹⁷** They came round about me like water all the day long; They compassed me about together. 

**¹⁸** Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.
