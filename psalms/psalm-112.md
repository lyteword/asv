# Psalm 112

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments. 

<sup>2</sup> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed. 

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous. 

<sup>5</sup> Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment. 

<sup>6</sup> For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah. 

<sup>8</sup> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his desire upon his adversaries. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor. 

<sup>10</sup> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.
