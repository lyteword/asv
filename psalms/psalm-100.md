# Psalm 100 

**¹** A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands. 

**²** Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come before his presence with singing. 

**³** Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

**⁴** Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his name. 

**⁵** For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness endureth for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.
