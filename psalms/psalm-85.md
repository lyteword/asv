# Psalm 85

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 

**²** Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah 

**³** Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 

**⁴** Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease. 

**⁵** Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 

**⁶** Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee? 

**⁷** Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation. 

**⁸** I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly. 

**⁹** Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land. 

**¹⁰** Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 

**¹¹** Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven. 

**¹²** Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase. 

**¹³** Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
