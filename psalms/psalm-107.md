# Psalm 107

**¹** O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**²** Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary, 

**³** And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south. 

**⁴** They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation. 

**⁵** Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them. 

**⁶** Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses, 

**⁷** He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation. 

**⁸** Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**⁹** For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good. 

**¹⁰** Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron, 

**¹¹** Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High: 

**¹²** Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help. 

**¹³** Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses. 

**¹⁴** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder. 

**¹⁵** Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**¹⁶** For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

**¹⁷** Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 

**¹⁸** Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death. 

**¹⁹** Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁰** He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions. 

**²¹** Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**²²** And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing. 

**²³** They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters; 

**²⁴** These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep. 

**²⁵** For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof. 

**²⁶** They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble. 

**²⁷** They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits’ end. 

**²⁸** Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁹** He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still. 

**³⁰** Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 

**³¹** Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**³²** Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders. 

**³³** He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground; 

**³⁴** A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 

**³⁵** He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings. 

**³⁶** And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation, 

**³⁷** And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase. 

**³⁸** He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 

**³⁹** Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 

**⁴⁰** He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. 

**⁴¹** Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock. 

**⁴²** The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

**⁴³** Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.
