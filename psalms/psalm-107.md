# Psalm 107

<sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary, 

<sup>3</sup> And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south. 

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation. 

<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them. 

<sup>6</sup> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses, 

<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation. 

<sup>8</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good. 

<sup>10</sup> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron, 

<sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High: 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder. 

<sup>15</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

<sup>17</sup> Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 

<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses. 

<sup>20</sup> He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions. 

<sup>21</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing. 

<sup>23</sup> They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters; 

<sup>24</sup> These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof. 

<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble. 

<sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their witsâ€™ end. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses. 

<sup>29</sup> He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still. 

<sup>30</sup> Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 

<sup>31</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground; 

<sup>34</sup> A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 

<sup>35</sup> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings. 

<sup>36</sup> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation, 

<sup>37</sup> And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase. 

<sup>38</sup> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 

<sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 

<sup>40</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. 

<sup>41</sup> Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

<sup>43</sup> Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.
