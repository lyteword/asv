# Psalm 15 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 

**²** He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart; 

**³** He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor; 

**⁴** In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; 

**⁵** He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
