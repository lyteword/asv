# Psalm 15

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 

<sup>2</sup> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart; 

<sup>3</sup> He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor; 

<sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; 

<sup>5</sup> He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
