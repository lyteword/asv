# Psalm 104 

**¹** Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: 

**²** Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; 

**³** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; 

**⁴** Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers; 

**⁵** Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever. 

**⁶** Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains. 

**⁷** At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away 

**⁸** (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 

**⁹** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth. 

**¹⁰** He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains; 

**¹¹** They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst. 

**¹²** By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches. 

**¹³** He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. 

**¹⁴** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth, 

**¹⁵** And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart. 

**¹⁶** The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

**¹⁷** Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. 

**¹⁸** The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies. 

**¹⁹** He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down. 

**²⁰** Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. 

**²¹** The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God. 

**²²** The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens. 

**²³** Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening. 

**²⁴** O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches. 

**²⁵** Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts. 

**²⁶** There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein. 

**²⁷** These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season. 

**²⁸** Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. 

**²⁹** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust. 

**³⁰** Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground. 

**³¹** Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: 

**³²** Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 

**³³** I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 

**³⁴** Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah. 

**³⁵** Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.
