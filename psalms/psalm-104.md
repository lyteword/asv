# Psalm 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: 

<sup>2</sup> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; 

<sup>3</sup> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; 

<sup>4</sup> Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers; 

<sup>5</sup> Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away 

<sup>8</sup> (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains; 

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. 

<sup>14</sup> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth, 

<sup>15</sup> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth manâ€™s heart. 

<sup>16</sup> The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

<sup>17</sup> Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. 

<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies. 

<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. 

<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God. 

<sup>22</sup> The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening. 

<sup>24</sup> O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches. 

<sup>25</sup> Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts. 

<sup>26</sup> There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein. 

<sup>27</sup> These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. 

<sup>29</sup> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust. 

<sup>30</sup> Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground. 

<sup>31</sup> Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: 

<sup>32</sup> Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 

<sup>33</sup> I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 

<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah. 

<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.
