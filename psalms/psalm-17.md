# Psalm 17

**¹** A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 

**²** Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity. 

**³** Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 

**⁴** As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 

**⁵** My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped. 

**⁶** I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 

**⁷** Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee From those that rise up against them. 

**⁸** Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

**⁹** From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about. 

**¹⁰** They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly. 

**¹¹** They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 

**¹²** He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

**¹³** Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; 

**¹⁴** From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 

**¹⁵** As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
