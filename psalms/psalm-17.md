# Psalm 17

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 

<sup>4</sup> As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 

<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped. 

<sup>6</sup> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 

<sup>7</sup> Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee From those that rise up against them. 

<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

<sup>9</sup> From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about. 

<sup>10</sup> They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly. 

<sup>11</sup> They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 

<sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; 

<sup>14</sup> From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 

<sup>15</sup> As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
