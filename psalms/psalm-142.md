# Psalm 142 

**¹** Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer. I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication. 

**²** I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble. 

**³** When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me. 

**⁴** Look on my right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul. 

**⁵** I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. 

**⁶** Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I. 

**⁷** Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
