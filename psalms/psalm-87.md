# Psalm 87

**¹** A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

**²** Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

**³** Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah 

**⁴** I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there. 

**⁵** Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her. 

**⁶** Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. Selah 

**⁷** They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.
