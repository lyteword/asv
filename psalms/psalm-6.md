# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled. 

<sup>3</sup> My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long? 

<sup>4</sup> Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindnessâ€™ sake. 

<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.
