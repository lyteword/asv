# Psalm 6 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

**²** Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled. 

**³** My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long? 

**⁴** Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. 

**⁵** For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks? 

**⁶** I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

**⁷** Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 

**⁸** Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

**⁹** Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer. 

**¹⁰** All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.
