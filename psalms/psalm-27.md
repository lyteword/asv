# Psalm 27

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid? 

**²** When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. 

**³** Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident. 

**⁴** One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple. 

**⁵** For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock. 

**⁶** And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah. 

**⁷** Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 

**⁸** When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek. 

**⁹** Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 

**¹⁰** When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up. 

**¹¹** Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies. 

**¹²** Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty. 

**¹³** I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living. 

**¹⁴** Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
