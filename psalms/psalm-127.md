# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. 

<sup>3</sup> Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward. 

<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
