# Psalm 127

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain. 

**²** It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. 

**³** Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward. 

**⁴** As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth. 

**⁵** Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
