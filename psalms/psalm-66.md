# Psalm 66

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Song, a Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth: 

<sup>2</sup> Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious. 

<sup>3</sup> Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. 

<sup>4</sup> All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. 

<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him. 

<sup>7</sup> He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard; 

<sup>9</sup> Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved. 

<sup>10</sup> For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins. 

<sup>12</sup> Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 

<sup>13</sup> I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows, 

<sup>14</sup> Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress. 

<sup>15</sup> I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 

<sup>17</sup> I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue. 

<sup>18</sup> If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear: 

<sup>19</sup> But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.
