# Psalm 124

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, Let Israel now say, 

**²** If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, When men rose up against us; 

**³** Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us: 

**⁴** Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul; 

**⁵** Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 

**⁶** Blessed be Jehovah, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

**⁷** Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped. 

**⁸** Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
