# Psalm 42

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after thee, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God? 

<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 

<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. 

<sup>5</sup> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him For the help of his countenance. 

<sup>6</sup> O my God, my soul is cast down within me: Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. 

<sup>7</sup> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 

<sup>8</sup> Yet Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with me, Even a prayer unto the God of my life. 

<sup>9</sup> I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 

<sup>11</sup> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
