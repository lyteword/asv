# Psalm 120 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me. 

**²** Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, And from a deceitful tongue. 

**³** What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue? 

**⁴** Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper. 

**⁵** Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

**⁶** My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace. 

**⁷** I am for peace: But when I speak, they are for war.
