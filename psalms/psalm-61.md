# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy. 

<sup>4</sup> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou wilt prolong the kingâ€™s life; His years shall be as many generations. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him. 

<sup>8</sup> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
