# Psalm 61

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer. 

**²** From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

**³** For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy. 

**⁴** I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah 

**⁵** For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 

**⁶** Thou wilt prolong the king’s life; His years shall be as many generations. 

**⁷** He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him. 

**⁸** So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
