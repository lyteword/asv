# Psalm 2

<sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing? 

<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us. 

<sup>4</sup> He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision. 

<sup>5</sup> Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure: 

<sup>6</sup> Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion. 

<sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potterâ€™s vessel. 

<sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 

<sup>12</sup> Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
