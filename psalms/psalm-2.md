# Psalm 2 

**¹** Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing? 

**²** The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying, 

**³** Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us. 

**⁴** He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision. 

**⁵** Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure: 

**⁶** Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion. 

**⁷** I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee. 

**⁸** Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 

**⁹** Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 

**¹⁰** Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

**¹¹** Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 

**¹²** Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
