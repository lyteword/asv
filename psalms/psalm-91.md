# Psalm 91 

**¹** He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

**²** I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust. 

**³** For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence. 

**⁴** He will cover thee with his pinions, And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler. 

**⁵** Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 

**⁶** For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

**⁷** A thousand shall fall at thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But it shall not come nigh thee. 

**⁸** Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the reward of the wicked. 

**⁹** For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; 

**¹⁰** There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. 

**¹¹** For he will give his angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways. 

**¹²** They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 

**¹³** Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot. 

**¹⁴** Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 

**¹⁵** He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him. 

**¹⁶** With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.
