# Psalm 91

<sup>1</sup> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

<sup>2</sup> I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust. 

<sup>3</sup> For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence. 

<sup>4</sup> He will cover thee with his pinions, And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 

<sup>6</sup> For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> A thousand shall fall at thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But it shall not come nigh thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the reward of the wicked. 

<sup>9</sup> For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; 

<sup>10</sup> There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. 

<sup>11</sup> For he will give his angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways. 

<sup>12</sup> They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot. 

<sup>14</sup> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 

<sup>15</sup> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him. 

<sup>16</sup> With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.
