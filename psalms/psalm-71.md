# Psalm 71

<sup>1</sup> In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge: Let me never be put to shame. 

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me: Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me. 

<sup>3</sup> Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: Thou hast given commandment to save me; For thou art my rock and my fortress. 

<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 

<sup>5</sup> For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah: Thou art my trust from my youth. 

<sup>6</sup> By thee have I been holden up from the womb; Thou art he that took me out of my motherâ€™s bowels: My praise shall be continually of thee. 

<sup>7</sup> I am as a wonder unto many; But thou art my strong refuge. 

<sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, And with thy honor all the day. 

<sup>9</sup> Cast me not off in the time of old age; Forsake me not when my strength faileth. 

<sup>10</sup> For mine enemies speak concerning me; And they that watch for my soul take counsel together, 

<sup>11</sup> Saying, God hath forsaken him: Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver. 

<sup>12</sup> O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me. 

<sup>13</sup> Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt. 

<sup>14</sup> But I will hope continually, And will praise thee yet more and more. 

<sup>15</sup> My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, And of thy salvation all the day; For I know not the numbers thereof. 

<sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Jehovah: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. 

<sup>17</sup> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. 

<sup>18</sup> Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not, Until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation, Thy might to every one that is to come. 

<sup>19</sup> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee? 

<sup>20</sup> Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles, Wilt quicken us again, And wilt bring us up again from the depths of the earth. 

<sup>21</sup> Increase thou my greatness, And turn again and comfort me. 

<sup>22</sup> I will also praise thee with the psaltery, Even thy truth, O my God: Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises unto thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed. 

<sup>24</sup> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
