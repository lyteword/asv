# Psalm 26

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering. 

<sup>2</sup> Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind. 

<sup>3</sup> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth. 

<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers. 

<sup>5</sup> I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah; 

<sup>7</sup> That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works. 

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth. 

<sup>9</sup> Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood; 

<sup>10</sup> In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes. 

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 

<sup>12</sup> My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
