# Psalm 26

**¹** A Psalm of David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering. 

**²** Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind. 

**³** For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth. 

**⁴** I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers. 

**⁵** I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked. 

**⁶** I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah; 

**⁷** That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works. 

**⁸** Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth. 

**⁹** Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood; 

**¹⁰** In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes. 

**¹¹** But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 

**¹²** My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
