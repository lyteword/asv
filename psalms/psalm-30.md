# Psalm 30

**¹** A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. A Psalm of David. I will extol thee, O Jehovah; for thou hast raised me up, And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 

**²** O Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 

**³** O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 

**⁴** Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of his, And give thanks to his holy memorial name. 

**⁵** For his anger is but for a moment; His favor is for a life-time: Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy cometh in the morning. 

**⁶** As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 

**⁷** Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled. 

**⁸** I cried to thee, O Jehovah; And unto Jehovah I made supplication: 

**⁹** What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 

**¹⁰** Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me: Jehovah, be thou my helper. 

**¹¹** Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 

**¹²** To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
