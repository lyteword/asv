# Psalm 11

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain; 

<sup>2</sup> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart; 

<sup>3</sup> If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do? 

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 

<sup>6</sup> Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

<sup>7</sup> For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.
