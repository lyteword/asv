# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth. 

<sup>6</sup> With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.
