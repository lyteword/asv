# Psalm 73 

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart. 

**²** But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped. 

**³** For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

**⁴** For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm. 

**⁵** They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men. 

**⁶** Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment. 

**⁷** Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish. 

**⁸** They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily. 

**⁹** They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth. 

**¹⁰** Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full cup are drained by them. 

**¹¹** And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High? 

**¹²** Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. 

**¹³** Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency; 

**¹⁴** For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning. 

**¹⁵** If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children. 

**¹⁶** When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me; 

**¹⁷** Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end. 

**¹⁸** Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction. 

**¹⁹** How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. 

**²⁰** As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image. 

**²¹** For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart: 

**²²** So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee. 

**²³** Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand. 

**²⁴** Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory. 

**²⁵** Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. 

**²⁶** My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. 

**²⁷** For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee. 

**²⁸** But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.
