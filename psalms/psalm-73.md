# Psalm 73

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped. 

<sup>3</sup> For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm. 

<sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment. 

<sup>7</sup> Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish. 

<sup>8</sup> They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily. 

<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full cup are drained by them. 

<sup>11</sup> And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High? 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency; 

<sup>14</sup> For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning. 

<sup>15</sup> If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children. 

<sup>16</sup> When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me; 

<sup>17</sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end. 

<sup>18</sup> Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. 

<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image. 

<sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart: 

<sup>22</sup> So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee. 

<sup>23</sup> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory. 

<sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. 

<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. 

<sup>27</sup> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee. 

<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.
