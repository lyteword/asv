# Psalm 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

<sup>2</sup> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. 

<sup>3</sup> He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake. 

<sup>4</sup> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over. 

<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
