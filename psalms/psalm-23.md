# Psalm 23 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

**²** He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. 

**³** He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 

**⁴** Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. 

**⁵** Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over. 

**⁶** Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
