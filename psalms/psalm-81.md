# Psalm 81 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 

**²** Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery. 

**³** Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day. 

**⁴** For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

**⁵** He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, Where I heard a language that I knew not. 

**⁶** I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket. 

**⁷** Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah 

**⁸** Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! 

**⁹** There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. 

**¹⁰** I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

**¹¹** But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me. 

**¹²** So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels. 

**¹³** Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways! 

**¹⁴** I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries. 

**¹⁵** The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever. 

**¹⁶** He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.
