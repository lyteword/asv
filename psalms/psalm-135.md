# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; Praise him, O ye servants of Jehovah, 

<sup>2</sup> Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye Jehovah; for Jehovah is good: Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 

<sup>4</sup> For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, And Israel for his own possession. 

<sup>5</sup> For I know that Jehovah is great, And that our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; 

<sup>7</sup> Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries; 

<sup>8</sup> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast; 

<sup>9</sup> Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants; 

<sup>10</sup> Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings, 

<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan, 

<sup>12</sup> And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel his people. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy name, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Thy memorial name, O Jehovah, throughout all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his servants. 

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of menâ€™s hands. 

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not; 

<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

<sup>19</sup> O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah: 

<sup>20</sup> O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah. 

<sup>21</sup> Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
