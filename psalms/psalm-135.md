# Psalm 135

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; Praise him, O ye servants of Jehovah, 

**²** Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God. 

**³** Praise ye Jehovah; for Jehovah is good: Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 

**⁴** For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, And Israel for his own possession. 

**⁵** For I know that Jehovah is great, And that our Lord is above all gods. 

**⁶** Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; 

**⁷** Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries; 

**⁸** Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast; 

**⁹** Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants; 

**¹⁰** Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings, 

**¹¹** Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan, 

**¹²** And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel his people. 

**¹³** Thy name, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Thy memorial name, O Jehovah, throughout all generations. 

**¹⁴** For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his servants. 

**¹⁵** The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands. 

**¹⁶** They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not; 

**¹⁷** They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths. 

**¹⁸** They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

**¹⁹** O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah: 

**²⁰** O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah. 

**²¹** Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
