# Psalm 60

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us. 

<sup>6</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. 

<sup>8</sup> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me. 

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom? 

<sup>10</sup> Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 

<sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man. 

<sup>12</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
