# Psalm 49 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world, 

**²** Both low and high, Rich and poor together. 

**³** My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 

**⁴** I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

**⁵** Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? 

**⁶** They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

**⁷** None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him 

**⁸** (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever), 

**⁹** That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption. 

**¹⁰** For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others. 

**¹¹** Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names. 

**¹²** But man being in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish. 

**¹³** This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah 

**¹⁴** They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd: And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it. 

**¹⁵** But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah 

**¹⁶** Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased: 

**¹⁷** For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him. 

**¹⁸** Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself), 

**¹⁹** He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light. 

**²⁰** Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.
