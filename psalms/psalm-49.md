# Psalm 49

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world, 

<sup>2</sup> Both low and high, Rich and poor together. 

<sup>3</sup> My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? 

<sup>6</sup> They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

<sup>7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him 

<sup>8</sup> (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever), 

<sup>9</sup> That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption. 

<sup>10</sup> For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names. 

<sup>12</sup> But man being in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah 

<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd: And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it. 

<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased: 

<sup>17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself), 

<sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light. 

<sup>20</sup> Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.
