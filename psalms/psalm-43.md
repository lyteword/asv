# Psalm 43

<sup>1</sup> Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 

<sup>2</sup> For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

<sup>3</sup> Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy tabernacles. 

<sup>4</sup> Then will I go unto the altar of God, Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God. 

<sup>5</sup> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
