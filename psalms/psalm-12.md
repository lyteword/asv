# Psalm 12

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth; For the faithful fail from among the children of men. 

<sup>2</sup> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. 

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh great things; 

<sup>4</sup> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 

<sup>5</sup> Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I will set him in the safety he panteth for. 

<sup>6</sup> The words of Jehovah are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever. 

<sup>8</sup> The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
