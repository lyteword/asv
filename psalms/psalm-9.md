# Psalm 9

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works. 

**²** I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. 

**³** When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence. 

**⁴** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously. 

**⁵** Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. 

**⁶** The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished. 

**⁷** But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment; 

**⁸** And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. 

**⁹** Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble; 

**¹⁰** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 

**¹¹** Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings. 

**¹²** For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor. 

**¹³** Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; 

**¹⁴** That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation. 

**¹⁵** The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 

**¹⁶** Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah 

**¹⁷** The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God. 

**¹⁸** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. 

**¹⁹** Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight. 

**²⁰** Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah
