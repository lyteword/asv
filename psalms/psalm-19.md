# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork. 

<sup>2</sup> Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard. 

<sup>4</sup> Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 

<sup>5</sup> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. 

<sup>6</sup> His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 

<sup>7</sup> The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple. 

<sup>8</sup> The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether. 

<sup>10</sup> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. 

<sup>11</sup> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults. 

<sup>13</sup> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.
