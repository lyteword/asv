# Psalm 19

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork. 

**²** Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge. 

**³** There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard. 

**⁴** Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 

**⁵** Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. 

**⁶** His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 

**⁷** The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple. 

**⁸** The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes. 

**⁹** The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether. 

**¹⁰** More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. 

**¹¹** Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward. 

**¹²** Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults. 

**¹³** Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression. 

**¹⁴** Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.
