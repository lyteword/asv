# Psalm 45 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves. My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 

**²** Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 

**³** Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty. 

**⁴** And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 

**⁵** Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under thee; They are in the heart of the king’s enemies. 

**⁶** Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 

**⁷** Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 

**⁸** All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad. 

**⁹** Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 

**¹⁰** Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house: 

**¹¹** So will the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; and reverence thou him. 

**¹²** And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 

**¹³** The king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold. 

**¹⁴** She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her Shall be brought unto thee. 

**¹⁵** With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: They shall enter into the king’s palace. 

**¹⁶** Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth. 

**¹⁷** I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.
