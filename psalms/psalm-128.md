# Psalm 128 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways. 

**²** For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 

**³** Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table. 

**⁴** Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah. 

**⁵** Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

**⁶** Yea, see thou thy children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
