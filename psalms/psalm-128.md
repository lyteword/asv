# Psalm 128

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways. 

<sup>2</sup> For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah. 

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

<sup>6</sup> Yea, see thou thy childrenâ€™s children. Peace be upon Israel.
