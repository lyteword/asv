# Psalm 38

**¹** A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

**²** For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore. 

**³** There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. 

**⁴** For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 

**⁵** My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness. 

**⁶** I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 

**⁷** For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh. 

**⁸** I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 

**⁹** Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee. 

**¹⁰** My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 

**¹¹** My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off. 

**¹²** They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long. 

**¹³** But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 

**¹⁴** Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs. 

**¹⁵** For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 

**¹⁶** For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 

**¹⁷** For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me. 

**¹⁸** For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 

**¹⁹** But mine enemies are lively, and are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 

**²⁰** They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good. 

**²¹** Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me. 

**²²** Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
