# Psalm 25 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul. 

**²** O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me. 

**³** Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause. 

**⁴** Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths. 

**⁵** Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day. 

**⁶** Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old. 

**⁷** Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah. 

**⁸** Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. 

**⁹** The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way. 

**¹⁰** All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 

**¹¹** For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great. 

**¹²** What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose. 

**¹³** His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land. 

**¹⁴** The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant. 

**¹⁵** Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net. 

**¹⁶** Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted. 

**¹⁷** The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses. 

**¹⁸** Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins. 

**¹⁹** Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred. 

**²⁰** Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee. 

**²¹** Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee. 

**²²** Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles.
