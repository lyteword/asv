# Psalm 25

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths. 

<sup>5</sup> Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day. 

<sup>6</sup> Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah. 

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. 

<sup>9</sup> The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way. 

<sup>10</sup> All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 

<sup>11</sup> For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great. 

<sup>12</sup> What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose. 

<sup>13</sup> His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land. 

<sup>14</sup> The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant. 

<sup>15</sup> Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net. 

<sup>16</sup> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted. 

<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses. 

<sup>18</sup> Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins. 

<sup>19</sup> Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred. 

<sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee. 

<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee. 

<sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles.
