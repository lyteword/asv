# Psalm 148 

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: Praise him in the heights. 

**²** Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his host. 

**³** Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light. 

**⁴** Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens. 

**⁵** Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created. 

**⁶** He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away. 

**⁷** Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 

**⁸** Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word; 

**⁹** Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars; 

**¹⁰** Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds; 

**¹¹** Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth; 

**¹²** Both young men and virgins; Old men and children: 

**¹³** Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens. 

**¹⁴** And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.
