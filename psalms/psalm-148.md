# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: Praise him in the heights. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his host. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light. 

<sup>4</sup> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away. 

<sup>7</sup> Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 

<sup>8</sup> Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word; 

<sup>9</sup> Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars; 

<sup>10</sup> Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds; 

<sup>11</sup> Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth; 

<sup>12</sup> Both young men and virgins; Old men and children: 

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens. 

<sup>14</sup> And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.
