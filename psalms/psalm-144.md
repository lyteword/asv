# Psalm 144

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, And my fingers to fight: 

<sup>2</sup> My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me. 

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? 

<sup>4</sup> Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away. 

<sup>5</sup> Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them. 

<sup>7</sup> Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens; 

<sup>8</sup> Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 

<sup>10</sup> Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 

<sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>12</sup> When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace; 

<sup>13</sup> When our garners are full, affording all manner of store, And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields; 

<sup>14</sup> When our oxen are well laden; When there is no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets: 

<sup>15</sup> Happy is the people that is in such a case; Yea, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.
