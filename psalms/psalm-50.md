# Psalm 50 

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 

**²** Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth. 

**³** Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him. 

**⁴** He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people: 

**⁵** Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 

**⁶** And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah 

**⁷** Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, even thy God. 

**⁸** I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. 

**⁹** I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds. 

**¹⁰** For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills. 

**¹¹** I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine. 

**¹²** If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. 

**¹³** Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats? 

**¹⁴** Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High; 

**¹⁵** And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. 

**¹⁶** But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth, 

**¹⁷** Seeing that thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee? 

**¹⁸** When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers. 

**¹⁹** Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit. 

**²⁰** Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. 

**²¹** These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. 

**²²** Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver: 

**²³** Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way aright Will I show the salvation of God.
