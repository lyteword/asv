# Psalm 14

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. 

<sup>3</sup> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah? 

<sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge. 

<sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
