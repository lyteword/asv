# Psalm 14 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good. 

**²** Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. 

**³** They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

**⁴** Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah? 

**⁵** There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous. 

**⁶** Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge. 

**⁷** Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
