# Psalm 77

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me. 

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times. 

<sup>6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search. 

<sup>7</sup> Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more? 

<sup>8</sup> Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore? 

<sup>9</sup> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah 

<sup>10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. 

<sup>11</sup> I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old. 

<sup>12</sup> I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God? 

<sup>14</sup> Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled. 

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad. 

<sup>18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook. 

<sup>19</sup> Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
