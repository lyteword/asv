# Psalm 77

**¹** For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me. 

**²** In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted. 

**³** I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah 

**⁴** Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

**⁵** I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times. 

**⁶** I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search. 

**⁷** Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more? 

**⁸** Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore? 

**⁹** Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah 

**¹⁰** And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. 

**¹¹** I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old. 

**¹²** I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings. 

**¹³** Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God? 

**¹⁴** Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. 

**¹⁵** Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 

**¹⁶** The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled. 

**¹⁷** The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad. 

**¹⁸** The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook. 

**¹⁹** Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known. 

**²⁰** Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
