# Psalm 143

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous. 

<sup>3</sup> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. 

<sup>4</sup> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate. 

<sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands. 

<sup>6</sup> I spread forth my hands unto thee: My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that go down into the pit. 

<sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. 

<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness. 

<sup>11</sup> Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy nameâ€™s sake: In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble. 

<sup>12</sup> And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul; For I am thy servant.
