# Psalm 134

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless ye Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, That by night stand in the house of Jehovah. 

<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And bless ye Jehovah. 

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah bless thee out of Zion; Even he that made heaven and earth.
