# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp. 

<sup>4</sup> For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand; 

<sup>7</sup> To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples; 

<sup>8</sup> To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 

<sup>9</sup> To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.
