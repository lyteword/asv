# Psalm 149 

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints. 

**²** Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

**³** Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp. 

**⁴** For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation. 

**⁵** Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds. 

**⁶** Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand; 

**⁷** To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples; 

**⁸** To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 

**⁹** To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.
