# Psalm 80 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth. 

**²** Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us. 

**³** Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

**⁴** O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 

**⁵** Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure. 

**⁶** Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves. 

**⁷** Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

**⁸** Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. 

**⁹** Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land. 

**¹⁰** The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God. 

**¹¹** It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River. 

**¹²** Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it? 

**¹³** The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it. 

**¹⁴** Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine, 

**¹⁵** And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁶** It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 

**¹⁷** Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁸** So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name. 

**¹⁹** Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
