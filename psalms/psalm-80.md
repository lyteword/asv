# Psalm 80

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth. 

<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us. 

<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

<sup>4</sup> O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves. 

<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God. 

<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River. 

<sup>12</sup> Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it? 

<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it. 

<sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine, 

<sup>15</sup> And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 

<sup>16</sup> It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 

<sup>17</sup> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 

<sup>18</sup> So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name. 

<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
