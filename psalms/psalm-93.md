# Psalm 93

<sup>1</sup> Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves. 

<sup>4</sup> Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.
