# Psalm 115

**¹** Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, But unto thy name give glory, For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake. 

**²** Wherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God? 

**³** But our God is in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever he pleased. 

**⁴** Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands. 

**⁵** They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not; 

**⁶** They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not; 

**⁷** They have hands, but they handle not; Feet have they, but they walk not; Neither speak they through their throat. 

**⁸** They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

**⁹** O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield. 

**¹⁰** O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield. 

**¹¹** Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield. 

**¹²** Jehovah hath been mindful of us; he will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron. 

**¹³** He will bless them that fear Jehovah, Both small and great. 

**¹⁴** Jehovah increase you more and more, You and your children. 

**¹⁵** Blessed are ye of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth. 

**¹⁶** The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah; But the earth hath he given to the children of men. 

**¹⁷** The dead praise not Jehovah, Neither any that go down into silence; 

**¹⁸** But we will bless Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye Jehovah.
