# Psalm 13

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 

<sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 

<sup>3</sup> Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 

<sup>4</sup> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. 

<sup>5</sup> But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
