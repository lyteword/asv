# Psalm 145

**¹** A Psalm of praise; of David. I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 

**²** Every day will I bless thee; And I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 

**³** Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; And his greatness is unsearchable. 

**⁴** One generation shall laud thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts. 

**⁵** Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate. 

**⁶** And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness. 

**⁷** They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness. 

**⁸** Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness. 

**⁹** Jehovah is good to all; And his tender mercies are over all his works. 

**¹⁰** All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee. 

**¹¹** They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power; 

**¹²** To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. 

**¹³** Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 

**¹⁴** Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down. 

**¹⁵** The eyes of all wait for thee; And thou givest them their food in due season. 

**¹⁶** Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 

**¹⁷** Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, And gracious in all his works. 

**¹⁸** Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth. 

**¹⁹** He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them. 

**²⁰** Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; But all the wicked will he destroy. 

**²¹** My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
