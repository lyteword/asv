# Psalm 103

**¹** A Psalm of David. Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless his holy name. 

**²** Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits: 

**³** Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases; 

**⁴** Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 

**⁵** Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle. 

**⁶** Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed. 

**⁷** He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel. 

**⁸** Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness. 

**⁹** He will not always chide; Neither will he keep his anger for ever. 

**¹⁰** He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities. 

**¹¹** For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him. 

**¹²** As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 

**¹³** Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him. 

**¹⁴** For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust. 

**¹⁵** As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 

**¹⁶** For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more. 

**¹⁷** But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children’s children; 

**¹⁸** To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them. 

**¹⁹** Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all. 

**²⁰** Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word. 

**²¹** Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 

**²²** Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
