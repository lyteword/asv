# Psalm 37

**¹** A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. 

**²** For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb. 

**³** Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on his faithfulness. 

**⁴** Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart. 

**⁵** Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass. 

**⁶** And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noonday. 

**⁷** Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 

**⁸** Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. 

**⁹** For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. 

**¹⁰** For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. 

**¹¹** But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

**¹²** The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 

**¹³** The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming. 

**¹⁴** The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way. 

**¹⁵** Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken. 

**¹⁶** Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked. 

**¹⁷** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. 

**¹⁸** Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever. 

**¹⁹** They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

**²⁰** But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away. 

**²¹** The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. 

**²²** For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off. 

**²³** A man’s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way. 

**²⁴** Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand. 

**²⁵** I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread. 

**²⁶** All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed. 

**²⁷** Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore. 

**²⁸** For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 

**²⁹** The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever. 

**³⁰** The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice. 

**³¹** The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide. 

**³²** The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him. 

**³³** Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged. 

**³⁴** Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. 

**³⁵** I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. 

**³⁶** But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 

**³⁷** Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a happy end to the man of peace. 

**³⁸** As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: The end of the wicked shall be cut off. 

**³⁹** But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 

**⁴⁰** And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them: He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
