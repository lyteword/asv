# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb. 

<sup>3</sup> Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on his faithfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart. 

<sup>5</sup> Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass. 

<sup>6</sup> And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 

<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. 

<sup>9</sup> For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. 

<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. 

<sup>11</sup> But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 

<sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way. 

<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away. 

<sup>21</sup> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. 

<sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> A manâ€™s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way. 

<sup>24</sup> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand. 

<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread. 

<sup>26</sup> All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed. 

<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore. 

<sup>28</sup> For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever. 

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice. 

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him. 

<sup>33</sup> Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged. 

<sup>34</sup> Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. 

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. 

<sup>36</sup> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a happy end to the man of peace. 

<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: The end of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them: He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
