# Psalm 133 

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity! 

**²** It is like the precious oil upon the head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard; That came down upon the skirt of his garments; 

**³** Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, Even life for evermore.
