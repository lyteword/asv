# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas; 

<sup>3</sup> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 

<sup>5</sup> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early. 

<sup>6</sup> The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted. 

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> Come, behold the works of Jehovah, What desolations he hath made in the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
