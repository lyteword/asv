# Psalm 33

**¹** Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous: Praise is comely for the upright. 

**²** Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp: Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings. 

**³** Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully with a loud noise. 

**⁴** For the word of Jehovah is right; And all his work is done in faithfulness. 

**⁵** He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah. 

**⁶** By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 

**⁷** He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses. 

**⁸** Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 

**⁹** For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. 

**¹⁰** Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. 

**¹¹** The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations. 

**¹²** Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 

**¹³** Jehovah looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men; 

**¹⁴** From the place of his habitation he looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth, 

**¹⁵** He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their works. 

**¹⁶** There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength. 

**¹⁷** A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither doth he deliver any by his great power. 

**¹⁸** Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness; 

**¹⁹** To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine. 

**²⁰** Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is our help and our shield. 

**²¹** For our heart shall rejoice in him, Because we have trusted in his holy name. 

**²²** Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.
