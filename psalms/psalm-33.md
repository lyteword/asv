# Psalm 33

<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous: Praise is comely for the upright. 

<sup>2</sup> Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp: Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings. 

<sup>3</sup> Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully with a loud noise. 

<sup>4</sup> For the word of Jehovah is right; And all his work is done in faithfulness. 

<sup>5</sup> He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah. 

<sup>6</sup> By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses. 

<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 

<sup>9</sup> For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. 

<sup>10</sup> Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. 

<sup>11</sup> The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 

<sup>13</sup> Jehovah looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men; 

<sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth, 

<sup>15</sup> He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their works. 

<sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength. 

<sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither doth he deliver any by his great power. 

<sup>18</sup> Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness; 

<sup>19</sup> To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine. 

<sup>20</sup> Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is our help and our shield. 

<sup>21</sup> For our heart shall rejoice in him, Because we have trusted in his holy name. 

<sup>22</sup> Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.
