# Psalm 3

**¹** A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me. 

**²** Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah 

**³** But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory, and the lifter up of my head. 

**⁴** I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah 

**⁵** I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me. 

**⁶** I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about. 

**⁷** Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 

**⁸** Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah
