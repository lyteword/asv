# Psalm 116

**¹** I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications. 

**²** Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 

**³** The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 

**⁴** Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 

**⁵** Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful. 

**⁶** Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. 

**⁷** Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee. 

**⁸** For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling. 

**⁹** I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living. 

**¹⁰** I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted: 

**¹¹** I said in my haste, All men are liars. 

**¹²** What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me? 

**¹³** I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah. 

**¹⁴** I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people. 

**¹⁵** Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints. 

**¹⁶** O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds. 

**¹⁷** I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah. 

**¹⁸** I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people, 

**¹⁹** In the courts of Jehovah’s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
