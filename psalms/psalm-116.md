# Psalm 116

<sup>1</sup> I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications. 

<sup>2</sup> Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 

<sup>3</sup> The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 

<sup>4</sup> Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful. 

<sup>6</sup> Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. 

<sup>7</sup> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee. 

<sup>8</sup> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling. 

<sup>9</sup> I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living. 

<sup>10</sup> I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted: 

<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste, All men are liars. 

<sup>12</sup> What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me? 

<sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah. 

<sup>14</sup> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people. 

<sup>15</sup> Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints. 

<sup>16</sup> O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds. 

<sup>17</sup> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah. 

<sup>18</sup> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people, 

<sup>19</sup> In the courts of Jehovahâ€™s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
