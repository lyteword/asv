# Psalm 147

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah; For it is good to sing praises unto our God; For it is pleasant, and praise is comely. 

**²** Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 

**³** He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds. 

**⁴** He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their names. 

**⁵** Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite. 

**⁶** Jehovah upholdeth the meek: He bringeth the wicked down to the ground. 

**⁷** Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; Sing praises upon the harp unto our God, 

**⁸** Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 

**⁹** He giveth to the beast his food, And to the young ravens which cry. 

**¹⁰** He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

**¹¹** Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him, In those that hope in his lovingkindness. 

**¹²** Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O Zion. 

**¹³** For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee. 

**¹⁴** He maketh peace in thy borders; He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 

**¹⁵** He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly. 

**¹⁶** He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. 

**¹⁷** He casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his cold? 

**¹⁸** He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

**¹⁹** He showeth his word unto Jacob, His statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. 

**²⁰** He hath not dealt so with any nation; And as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.
