# Psalm 147

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah; For it is good to sing praises unto our God; For it is pleasant, and praise is comely. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds. 

<sup>4</sup> He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their names. 

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite. 

<sup>6</sup> Jehovah upholdeth the meek: He bringeth the wicked down to the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; Sing praises upon the harp unto our God, 

<sup>8</sup> Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 

<sup>9</sup> He giveth to the beast his food, And to the young ravens which cry. 

<sup>10</sup> He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him, In those that hope in his lovingkindness. 

<sup>12</sup> Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O Zion. 

<sup>13</sup> For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee. 

<sup>14</sup> He maketh peace in thy borders; He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 

<sup>15</sup> He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly. 

<sup>16</sup> He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> He casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his cold? 

<sup>18</sup> He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

<sup>19</sup> He showeth his word unto Jacob, His statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. 

<sup>20</sup> He hath not dealt so with any nation; And as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.
