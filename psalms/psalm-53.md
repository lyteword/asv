# Psalm 53

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good. 

<sup>2</sup> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. 

<sup>3</sup> Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon God? 

<sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. 

<sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
