# Psalm 141 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. 

**²** Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 

**³** Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips. 

**⁴** Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties. 

**⁵** Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue. 

**⁶** Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 

**⁷** As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 

**⁸** For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute. 

**⁹** Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁰** Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.
