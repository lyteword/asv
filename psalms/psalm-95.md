# Psalm 95 

**¹** Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

**²** Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

**³** For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods. 

**⁴** In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also. 

**⁵** The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land. 

**⁶** Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: 

**⁷** For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice! 

**⁸** Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; 

**⁹** When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work. 

**¹⁰** Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways: 

**¹¹** Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.
