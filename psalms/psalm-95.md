# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

<sup>3</sup> For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also. 

<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land. 

<sup>6</sup> Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: 

<sup>7</sup> For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice! 

<sup>8</sup> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; 

<sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work. 

<sup>10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways: 

<sup>11</sup> Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.
