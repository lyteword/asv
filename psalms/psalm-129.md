# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say, 

<sup>2</sup> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me. 

<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows. 

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion. 

<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up; 

<sup>7</sup> Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom: 

<sup>8</sup> Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
