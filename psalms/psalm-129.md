# Psalm 129 

**¹** A Song of Ascents. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say, 

**²** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me. 

**³** The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows. 

**⁴** Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

**⁵** Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion. 

**⁶** Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up; 

**⁷** Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom: 

**⁸** Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
