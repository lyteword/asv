# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast given him his heartâ€™s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him. 

<sup>6</sup> For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. 

<sup>7</sup> For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform. 

<sup>12</sup> For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face. 

<sup>13</sup> Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.
