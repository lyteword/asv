# Psalm 62

**¹** For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him cometh my salvation. 

**²** He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved. 

**³** How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? 

**⁴** They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah 

**⁵** My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him. 

**⁶** He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be moved. 

**⁷** With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 

**⁸** Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah 

**⁹** Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity. 

**¹⁰** Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 

**¹¹** God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God. 

**¹²** Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
