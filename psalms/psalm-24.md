# Psalm 24

**¹** A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein. 

**²** For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods. 

**³** Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place? 

**⁴** He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully. 

**⁵** He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

**⁶** This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, even Jacob. Selah 

**⁷** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. 

**⁸** Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. 

**⁹** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. 

**¹⁰** Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah
