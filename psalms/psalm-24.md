# Psalm 24

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovahâ€™s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein. 

<sup>2</sup> For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods. 

<sup>3</sup> Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place? 

<sup>4</sup> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully. 

<sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, even Jacob. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. 

<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. 

<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah
