<sup>1</sup> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Oh give thanks unto the Lord of lords; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>4</sup> To him who alone doeth great wonders; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>5</sup> To him that by understanding made the heavens; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>6</sup> To him that spread forth the earth above the waters; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>7</sup> To him that made great lights; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>8</sup> The sun to rule by day; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>9</sup> The moon and stars to rule by night; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>10</sup> To him that smote Egypt in their first-born; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>11</sup> And brought out Israel from among them; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>12</sup> With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>13</sup> To him that divided the Red Sea in sunder; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>14</sup> And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>15</sup> But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>16</sup> To him that led his people through the wilderness; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>17</sup> To him that smote great kings; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>18</sup> And slew famous kings; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>19</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 

<sup>20</sup> And Og king of Bashan; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>21</sup> And gave their land for a heritage; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>22</sup> Even a heritage unto Israel his servant; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>23</sup> Who remembered us in our low estate; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 

<sup>24</sup> And hath delivered us from our adversaries; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever: 

<sup>25</sup> Who giveth food to all flesh; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>26</sup> Oh give thanks unto the God of heaven; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
