# Psalm 130

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah. 

<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>3</sup> If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 

<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared. 

<sup>5</sup> I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul waiteth for the Lord More than watchmen wait for the morning; Yea, more than watchmen for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption. 

<sup>8</sup> And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
