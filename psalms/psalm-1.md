# Psalm 1 

**¹** Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers: 

**²** But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night. 

**³** And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

**⁴** The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

**⁵** Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

**⁶** For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.
