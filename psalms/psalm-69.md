# Psalm 69

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. A Psalm of David. Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 

<sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore. 

<sup>5</sup> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee. 

<sup>6</sup> Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my motherâ€™s children. 

<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach. 

<sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them. 

<sup>12</sup> They that sit in the gate talk of me; And I am the song of the drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation. 

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me. 

<sup>16</sup> Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me. 

<sup>17</sup> And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily. 

<sup>18</sup> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies. 

<sup>19</sup> Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee. 

<sup>20</sup> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none. 

<sup>21</sup> They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 

<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap. 

<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake. 

<sup>24</sup> Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. 

<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded. 

<sup>27</sup> Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous. 

<sup>29</sup> But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 

<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving. 

<sup>31</sup> And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, Or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 

<sup>32</sup> The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live. 

<sup>33</sup> For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners. 

<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein. 

<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession. 

<sup>36</sup> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
