# Psalm 75

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works. 

**²** When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. 

**³** The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah 

**⁴** I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 

**⁵** Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck. 

**⁶** For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up. 

**⁷** But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. 

**⁸** For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. 

**⁹** But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

**¹⁰** All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
