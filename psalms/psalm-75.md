# Psalm 75

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works. 

<sup>2</sup> When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. 

<sup>3</sup> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 

<sup>5</sup> Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck. 

<sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up. 

<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. 

<sup>8</sup> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>10</sup> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
