# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Let them now that fear Jehovah say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

<sup>5</sup> Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah: Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place. 

<sup>6</sup> Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do unto me? 

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> All nations compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

<sup>11</sup> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

<sup>12</sup> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; But Jehovah helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> Jehovah is my strength and song; And he is become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of Jehovah is exalted: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 

<sup>17</sup> I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of Jehovah. 

<sup>18</sup> Jehovah hath chastened me sore; But he hath not given me over unto death. 

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah. 

<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of Jehovah; The righteous shall enter into it. 

<sup>21</sup> I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner. 

<sup>23</sup> This is Jehovahâ€™s doing; It is marvellous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> This is the day which Jehovah hath made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. 

<sup>25</sup> Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

<sup>26</sup> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah: We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah. 

<sup>27</sup> Jehovah is God, and he hath given us light: Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: Thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 

<sup>29</sup> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
