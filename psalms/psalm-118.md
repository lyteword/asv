# Psalm 118 

**¹** Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**²** Let Israel now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**³** Let the house of Aaron now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**⁴** Let them now that fear Jehovah say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever. 

**⁵** Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah: Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place. 

**⁶** Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do unto me? 

**⁷** Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 

**⁸** It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in man. 

**⁹** It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in princes. 

**¹⁰** All nations compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

**¹¹** They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

**¹²** They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 

**¹³** Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; But Jehovah helped me. 

**¹⁴** Jehovah is my strength and song; And he is become my salvation. 

**¹⁵** The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁶** The right hand of Jehovah is exalted: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁷** I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of Jehovah. 

**¹⁸** Jehovah hath chastened me sore; But he hath not given me over unto death. 

**¹⁹** Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah. 

**²⁰** This is the gate of Jehovah; The righteous shall enter into it. 

**²¹** I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation. 

**²²** The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner. 

**²³** This is Jehovah’s doing; It is marvellous in our eyes. 

**²⁴** This is the day which Jehovah hath made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. 

**²⁵** Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

**²⁶** Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah: We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah. 

**²⁷** Jehovah is God, and he hath given us light: Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 

**²⁸** Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: Thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 

**²⁹** Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
