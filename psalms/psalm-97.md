# Psalm 97 

**¹** Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad. 

**²** Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 

**³** A fire goeth before him, And burneth up his adversaries round about. 

**⁴** His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled. 

**⁵** The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

**⁶** The heavens declare his righteousness, And all the peoples have seen his glory. 

**⁷** Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods. 

**⁸** Zion heard and was glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoiced, Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah. 

**⁹** For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: Thou art exalted far above all gods. 

**¹⁰** O ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: He preserveth the souls of his saints; He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 

**¹¹** Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart. 

**¹²** Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
