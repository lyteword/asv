# Psalm 97

<sup>1</sup> Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad. 

<sup>2</sup> Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 

<sup>3</sup> A fire goeth before him, And burneth up his adversaries round about. 

<sup>4</sup> His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled. 

<sup>5</sup> The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

<sup>6</sup> The heavens declare his righteousness, And all the peoples have seen his glory. 

<sup>7</sup> Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods. 

<sup>8</sup> Zion heard and was glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoiced, Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah. 

<sup>9</sup> For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: Thou art exalted far above all gods. 

<sup>10</sup> O ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: He preserveth the souls of his saints; He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart. 

<sup>12</sup> Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
