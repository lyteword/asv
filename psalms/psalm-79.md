# Psalm 79

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. 

<sup>2</sup> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them. 

<sup>4</sup> We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us. 

<sup>5</sup> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 

<sup>6</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. 

<sup>7</sup> For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low. 

<sup>9</sup> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy nameâ€™s sake. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death; 

<sup>12</sup> And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.
