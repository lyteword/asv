# Psalm 68

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David, a Song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him. 

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 

<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: Yea, let them rejoice with gladness. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; His name is Jehovah; and exult ye before him. 

<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation. 

<sup>6</sup> God setteth the solitary in families: He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious dwell in a parched land. 

<sup>7</sup> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah 

<sup>8</sup> The earth trembled, The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God: Yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 

<sup>10</sup> Thy congregation dwelt therein: Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord giveth the word: The women that publish the tidings are a great host. 

<sup>12</sup> Kings of armies flee, they flee; And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. 

<sup>13</sup> When ye lie among the sheepfolds, It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold. 

<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings therein, It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon. 

<sup>15</sup> A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan. 

<sup>16</sup> Why look ye askance, ye high mountains, At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever. 

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands: The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary. 

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led away captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, among the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell with them. 

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah 

<sup>20</sup> God is unto us a God of deliverances; And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death. 

<sup>21</sup> But God will smite through the head of his enemies, The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depths of the sea; 

<sup>23</sup> That thou mayest crush them, dipping thy foot in blood, That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies. 

<sup>24</sup> They have seen thy goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. 

<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels. 

<sup>26</sup> Bless ye God in the congregations, Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah and their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> Thy God hath commanded thy strength: Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 

<sup>29</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem Kings shall bring presents unto thee. 

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war. 

<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God. 

<sup>32</sup> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; Oh sing praises unto the Lord; Selah 

<sup>33</sup> To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old; Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice. 

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies. 

<sup>35</sup> O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
