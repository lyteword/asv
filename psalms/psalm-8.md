# Psalm 8

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! 

**²** Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

**³** When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

**⁴** What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

**⁵** For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor. 

**⁶** Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet: 

**⁷** All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field, 

**⁸** The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 

**⁹** O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
