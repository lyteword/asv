# Psalm 8

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! 

<sup>2</sup> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>3</sup> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

<sup>4</sup> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

<sup>5</sup> For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet: 

<sup>7</sup> All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field, 

<sup>8</sup> The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
