# Psalm 51

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 

<sup>2</sup> Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. 

<sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me. 

<sup>4</sup> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in thy sight; That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me. 

<sup>6</sup> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts; And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom. 

<sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

<sup>8</sup> Make me to hear joy and gladness, That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities. 

<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit within me. 

<sup>11</sup> Cast me not away from thy presence; And take not thy holy Spirit from me. 

<sup>12</sup> Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; And uphold me with a willing spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; And sinners shall be converted unto thee. 

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 

<sup>15</sup> O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth shall show forth thy praise. 

<sup>16</sup> For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it: Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering. 

<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 

<sup>18</sup> Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> Then wilt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
