# Psalm 137

**¹** By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion. 

**²** Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps. 

**³** For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

**⁴** How shall we sing Jehovah’s song In a foreign land? 

**⁵** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her skill. 

**⁶** Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy. 

**⁷** Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof. 

**⁸** O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us. 

**⁹** Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.
