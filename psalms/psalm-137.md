# Psalm 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps. 

<sup>3</sup> For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

<sup>4</sup> How shall we sing Jehovahâ€™s song In a foreign land? 

<sup>5</sup> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her skill. 

<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof. 

<sup>8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us. 

<sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.
