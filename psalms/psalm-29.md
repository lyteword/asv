# Psalm 29

**¹** A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. 

**²** Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array. 

**³** The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters. 

**⁴** The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty. 

**⁵** The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 

**⁶** He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. 

**⁷** The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire. 

**⁸** The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 

**⁹** The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory. 

**¹⁰** Jehovah sat as King at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever. 

**¹¹** Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
