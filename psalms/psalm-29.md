# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. 

<sup>2</sup> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array. 

<sup>3</sup> The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters. 

<sup>4</sup> The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty. 

<sup>5</sup> The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. 

<sup>7</sup> The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire. 

<sup>8</sup> The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 

<sup>9</sup> The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory. 

<sup>10</sup> Jehovah sat as King at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever. 

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
