# Psalm 67

**¹** For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm, a Song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, And cause his face to shine upon us; Selah 

**²** That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations. 

**³** Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee. 

**⁴** Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations upon earth. Selah 

**⁵** Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee. 

**⁶** The earth hath yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us. 

**⁷** God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
