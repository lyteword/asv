# Psalm 102 

**¹** A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee. 

**²** Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily. 

**³** For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand. 

**⁴** My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread. 

**⁵** By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh. 

**⁶** I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. 

**⁷** I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top. 

**⁸** Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me. 

**⁹** For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping, 

**¹⁰** Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. 

**¹¹** My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass. 

**¹²** But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial name unto all generations. 

**¹³** Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come. 

**¹⁴** For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust. 

**¹⁵** So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory. 

**¹⁶** For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory. 

**¹⁷** He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer. 

**¹⁸** This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah. 

**¹⁹** For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth; 

**²⁰** To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death; 

**²¹** That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem; 

**²²** When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah. 

**²³** He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days. 

**²⁴** I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations. 

**²⁵** Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands. 

**²⁶** They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 

**²⁷** But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end. 

**²⁸** The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee.
