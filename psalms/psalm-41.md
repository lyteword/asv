# Psalm 41 

**¹** For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil. 

**²** Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. 

**³** Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness. 

**⁴** I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 

**⁵** Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish? 

**⁶** And if he come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad, he telleth it. 

**⁷** All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise my hurt. 

**⁸** An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 

**⁹** Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me. 

**¹⁰** But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, That I may requite them. 

**¹¹** By this I know that thou delightest in me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 

**¹²** And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever. 

**¹³** Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
