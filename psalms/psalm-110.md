# Psalm 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth. 

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek. 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>6</sup> He will judge among the nations, He will fill the places with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries. 

<sup>7</sup> He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.
