# Psalm 5 

**¹** For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation. 

**²** Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray. 

**³** O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch. 

**⁴** For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee. 

**⁵** The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

**⁶** Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man. 

**⁷** But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 

**⁸** Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face. 

**⁹** For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue. 

**¹⁰** Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee. 

**¹¹** But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 

**¹²** For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
