# Psalm 83

<sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 

<sup>3</sup> They take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones. 

<sup>4</sup> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 

<sup>5</sup> For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant: 

<sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes; 

<sup>7</sup> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: 

<sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; 

<sup>10</sup> Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna; 

<sup>12</sup> Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God. 

<sup>13</sup> O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind. 

<sup>14</sup> As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire, 

<sup>15</sup> So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm. 

<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah. 

<sup>17</sup> Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish; 

<sup>18</sup> That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.
