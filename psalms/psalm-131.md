# Psalm 131

**¹** A Song of Ascents; of David. Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me. 

**²** Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

**³** O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
