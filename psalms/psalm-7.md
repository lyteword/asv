# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me, 

<sup>2</sup> Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands; 

<sup>4</sup> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary); 

<sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. 

<sup>7</sup> And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high. 

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts. 

<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day. 

<sup>12</sup> If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready; 

<sup>13</sup> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery shafts. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made. 

<sup>16</sup> His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate. 

<sup>17</sup> I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
