# Psalm 105 

**¹** Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings. 

**²** Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works. 

**³** Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. 

**⁴** Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore. 

**⁵** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 

**⁶** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

**⁷** He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth. 

**⁸** He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 

**⁹** The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac, 

**¹⁰** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant, 

**¹¹** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; 

**¹²** When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it. 

**¹³** And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people. 

**¹⁴** He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 

**¹⁵** Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. 

**¹⁶** And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread. 

**¹⁷** He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant: 

**¹⁸** His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in chains of iron, 

**¹⁹** Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him. 

**²⁰** The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 

**²¹** He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance; 

**²²** To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom. 

**²³** Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

**²⁴** And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries. 

**²⁵** He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants. 

**²⁶** He sent Moses his servant, And Aaron whom he had chosen. 

**²⁷** They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham. 

**²⁸** He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words. 

**²⁹** He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish. 

**³⁰** Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings. 

**³¹** He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders. 

**³²** He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land. 

**³³** He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders. 

**³⁴** He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number, 

**³⁵** And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground. 

**³⁶** He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength. 

**³⁷** And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes. 

**³⁸** Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them. 

**³⁹** He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night. 

**⁴⁰** They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

**⁴¹** He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places like a river. 

**⁴²** For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham his servant. 

**⁴³** And he brought forth his people with joy, And his chosen with singing. 

**⁴⁴** And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession: 

**⁴⁵** That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.
