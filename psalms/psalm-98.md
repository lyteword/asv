# Psalm 98

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. 

<sup>5</sup> Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody. 

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein; 

<sup>8</sup> Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together 

<sup>9</sup> Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.
