# Psalm 99 

**¹** Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 

**²** Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples. 

**³** Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he. 

**⁴** The king’s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

**⁵** Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he. 

**⁶** Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. 

**⁷** He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them. 

**⁸** Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 

**⁹** Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.
