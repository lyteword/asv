# Psalm 99

<sup>1</sup> Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he. 

<sup>4</sup> The kingâ€™s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he. 

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. 

<sup>7</sup> He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 

<sup>9</sup> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.
