# Psalm 94

<sup>1</sup> O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth. 

<sup>2</sup> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud their desert. 

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph? 

<sup>4</sup> They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves. 

<sup>5</sup> They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless. 

<sup>7</sup> And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider. 

<sup>8</sup> Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise? 

<sup>9</sup> He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see? 

<sup>10</sup> He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, Even he that teacheth man knowledge? 

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law; 

<sup>13</sup> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked. 

<sup>14</sup> For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance. 

<sup>15</sup> For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it. 

<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>17</sup> Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence. 

<sup>18</sup> When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up. 

<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul. 

<sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute? 

<sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood. 

<sup>22</sup> But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge. 

<sup>23</sup> And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.
