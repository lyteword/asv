# Psalm 113

**¹** Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah. 

**²** Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore. 

**³** From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovah’s name is to be praised. 

**⁴** Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens. 

**⁵** Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high, 

**⁶** That humbleth himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth? 

**⁷** He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; 

**⁸** That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people. 

**⁹** He maketh the barren woman to keep house, And to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.
