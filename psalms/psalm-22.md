# Psalm 22

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Aijeleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning? 

<sup>2</sup> O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent. 

<sup>3</sup> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 

<sup>5</sup> They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame. 

<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people. 

<sup>7</sup> All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 

<sup>8</sup> Commit thyself unto Jehovah; let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him. 

<sup>9</sup> But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts. 

<sup>10</sup> I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me. 

<sup>11</sup> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help. 

<sup>12</sup> Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 

<sup>13</sup> They gape upon me with their mouth, As a ravening and a roaring lion. 

<sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me. 

<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 

<sup>16</sup> For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet. 

<sup>17</sup> I may count all my bones. They look and stare upon me; 

<sup>18</sup> They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots. 

<sup>19</sup> But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me. 

<sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog. 

<sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion’s mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me. 

<sup>22</sup> I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee. 

<sup>23</sup> Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel. 

<sup>24</sup> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard. 

<sup>25</sup> Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 

<sup>26</sup> The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever. 

<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 

<sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; And he is the ruler over the nations. 

<sup>29</sup> All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive. 

<sup>30</sup> A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation. 

<sup>31</sup> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.
