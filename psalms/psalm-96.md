# Psalm 96

**¹** Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. 

**²** Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show forth his salvation from day to day. 

**³** Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. 

**⁴** For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods. 

**⁵** For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens. 

**⁶** Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

**⁷** Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. 

**⁸** Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

**⁹** Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth. 

**¹⁰** Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity. 

**¹¹** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 

**¹²** Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy 

**¹³** Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth.
