# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show forth his salvation from day to day. 

<sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 

<sup>12</sup> Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy 

<sup>13</sup> Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth.
