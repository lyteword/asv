# Psalm 39

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me. 

<sup>2</sup> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred. 

<sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned; Then spake I with my tongue: 

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 

<sup>7</sup> And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish. 

<sup>9</sup> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it. 

<sup>10</sup> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand. 

<sup>11</sup> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. Selah 

<sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were. 

<sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.
