# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come? 

<sup>2</sup> My help cometh from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night. 

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul. 

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore.
