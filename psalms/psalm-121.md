# Psalm 121

**¹** A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come? 

**²** My help cometh from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth. 

**³** He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber. 

**⁴** Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. 

**⁵** Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand. 

**⁶** The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night. 

**⁷** Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul. 

**⁸** Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore.
