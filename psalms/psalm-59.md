# Psalm 59

**¹** For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: Set me on high from them that rise up against me. 

**²** Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men. 

**³** For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah. 

**⁴** They run and prepare themselves without my fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold. 

**⁵** Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah 

**⁶** They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city. 

**⁷** Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, say they, doth hear? 

**⁸** But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision. 

**⁹** Because of his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower. 

**¹⁰** My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see my desire upon mine enemies. 

**¹¹** Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 

**¹²** For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak. 

**¹³** Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. Selah 

**¹⁴** And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city. 

**¹⁵** They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied. 

**¹⁶** But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress. 

**¹⁷** Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
