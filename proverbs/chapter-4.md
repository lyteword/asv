# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding: 

<sup>2</sup> For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law. 

<sup>3</sup> For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 

<sup>4</sup> And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live; 

<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth; 

<sup>6</sup> Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee. 

<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. 

<sup>9</sup> She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee. 

<sup>10</sup> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many. 

<sup>11</sup> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness. 

<sup>12</sup> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 

<sup>13</sup> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life. 

<sup>14</sup> Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men. 

<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on. 

<sup>16</sup> For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. 

<sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. 

<sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart. 

<sup>22</sup> For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh. 

<sup>23</sup> Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life. 

<sup>24</sup> Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee. 

<sup>25</sup> Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee. 

<sup>26</sup> Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established. 

<sup>27</sup> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil.
