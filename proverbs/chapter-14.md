# Proverbs 14 

**¹** Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands. 

**²** He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 

**³** In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 

**⁴** Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox. 

**⁵** A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies. 

**⁶** A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. 

**⁷** Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge. 

**⁸** The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit. 

**⁹** A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will. 

**¹⁰** The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. 

**¹¹** The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish. 

**¹²** There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death. 

**¹³** Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness. 

**¹⁴** The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man shall be satisfied from himself. 

**¹⁵** The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going. 

**¹⁶** A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident. 

**¹⁷** He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated. 

**¹⁸** The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

**¹⁹** The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous. 

**²⁰** The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends. 

**²¹** He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he. 

**²²** Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. 

**²³** In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 

**²⁴** The crown of the wise is their riches; But the folly of fools is only folly. 

**²⁵** A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies causeth deceit. 

**²⁶** In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge. 

**²⁷** The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. 

**²⁸** In the multitude of people is the king’s glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. 

**²⁹** He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 

**³⁰** A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones. 

**³¹** He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him. 

**³²** The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death. 

**³³** Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But that which is in the inward part of fools is made known. 

**³⁴** Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people. 

**³⁵** The king’s favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be against him that causeth shame.
