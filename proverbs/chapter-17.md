# Chapter 17

**¹** Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife. 

**²** A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren. 

**³** The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Jehovah trieth the hearts. 

**⁴** An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue. 

**⁵** Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. 

**⁶** Children’s children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers. 

**⁷** Excellent speech becometh not a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince. 

**⁸** A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 

**⁹** He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends. 

**¹⁰** A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool. 

**¹¹** An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 

**¹²** Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly. 

**¹³** Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house. 

**¹⁴** The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling. 

**¹⁵** He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. 

**¹⁶** Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding? 

**¹⁷** A friend loveth at all times; And a brother is born for adversity. 

**¹⁸** A man void of understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor. 

**¹⁹** He loveth transgression that loveth strife: He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction. 

**²⁰** He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 

**²¹** He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; And the father of a fool hath no joy. 

**²²** A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones. 

**²³** A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice. 

**²⁴** Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 

**²⁵** A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bare him. 

**²⁶** Also to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to smite the noble for their uprightness. 

**²⁷** He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 

**²⁸** Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.
