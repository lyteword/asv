# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 

<sup>2</sup> When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice; But when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh. 

<sup>3</sup> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance. 

<sup>4</sup> The king by justice establisheth the land; But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. 

<sup>5</sup> A man that flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his steps. 

<sup>6</sup> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; But the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 

<sup>7</sup> The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked hath not understanding to know it. 

<sup>8</sup> Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath. 

<sup>9</sup> If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest. 

<sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect; And as for the upright, they seek his life. 

<sup>11</sup> A fool uttereth all his anger; But a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it. 

<sup>12</sup> If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, All his servants are wicked. 

<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor meet together; Jehovah lighteneth the eyes of them both. 

<sup>14</sup> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, His throne shall be established for ever. 

<sup>15</sup> The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. 

<sup>16</sup> When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth; But the righteous shall look upon their fall. 

<sup>17</sup> Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; Yea, he will give delight unto thy soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 

<sup>19</sup> A servant will not be corrected by words; For though he understand, he will not give heed. 

<sup>20</sup> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him. 

<sup>21</sup> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child Shall have him become a son at the last. 

<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirreth up strife, And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression. 

<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride shall bring him low; But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor. 

<sup>24</sup> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. 

<sup>25</sup> The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe. 

<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor; But a man’s judgment cometh from Jehovah. 

<sup>27</sup> An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
