# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are bold as a lion. 

<sup>2</sup> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. 

<sup>3</sup> A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 

<sup>4</sup> They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them. 

<sup>5</sup> Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek Jehovah understand all things. 

<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 

<sup>7</sup> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father. 

<sup>8</sup> He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. 

<sup>9</sup> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination. 

<sup>10</sup> Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the perfect shall inherit good. 

<sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 

<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. 

<sup>13</sup> He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. 

<sup>14</sup> Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 

<sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, So is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 

<sup>16</sup> The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 

<sup>17</sup> A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him. 

<sup>18</sup> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 

<sup>19</sup> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 

<sup>20</sup> A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>21</sup> To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. 

<sup>22</sup> He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor Than he that flattereth with the tongue. 

<sup>24</sup> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, The same is the companion of a destroyer. 

<sup>25</sup> He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat. 

<sup>26</sup> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 

<sup>27</sup> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 

<sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
