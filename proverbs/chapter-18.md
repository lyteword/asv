# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom. 

<sup>2</sup> A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself. 

<sup>3</sup> When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy cometh reproach. 

<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook. 

<sup>5</sup> To respect the person of the wicked is not good, Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment. 

<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes. 

<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. 

<sup>9</sup> He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer. 

<sup>10</sup> The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe. 

<sup>11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination. 

<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor goeth humility. 

<sup>13</sup> He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him. 

<sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear? 

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 

<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men. 

<sup>17</sup> He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out. 

<sup>18</sup> The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty. 

<sup>19</sup> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; And such contentions are like the bars of a castle. 

<sup>20</sup> A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied. 

<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 

<sup>22</sup> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah. 

<sup>23</sup> The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly. 

<sup>24</sup> He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
