# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. 

<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life. 

<sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling. 

<sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. 

<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out. 

<sup>6</sup> Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find? 

<sup>7</sup> A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him. 

<sup>8</sup> A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 

<sup>10</sup> Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. 

<sup>11</sup> Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 

<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them. 

<sup>13</sup> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>14</sup> It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 

<sup>15</sup> There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 

<sup>16</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners. 

<sup>17</sup> Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 

<sup>18</sup> Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war. 

<sup>19</sup> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips. 

<sup>20</sup> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. 

<sup>21</sup> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed. 

<sup>22</sup> Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee. 

<sup>23</sup> Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good. 

<sup>24</sup> A manâ€™s goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way? 

<sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, And after vows to make inquiry. 

<sup>26</sup> A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the threshing-wheel over them. 

<sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts. 

<sup>28</sup> Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness. 

<sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head. 

<sup>30</sup> Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes reach the innermost parts.
