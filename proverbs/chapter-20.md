# Proverbs 20 

**¹** Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. 

**²** The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life. 

**³** It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling. 

**⁴** The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. 

**⁵** Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out. 

**⁶** Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find? 

**⁷** A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him. 

**⁸** A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 

**⁹** Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 

**¹⁰** Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. 

**¹¹** Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 

**¹²** The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them. 

**¹³** Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 

**¹⁴** It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 

**¹⁵** There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 

**¹⁶** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners. 

**¹⁷** Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 

**¹⁸** Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war. 

**¹⁹** He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips. 

**²⁰** Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. 

**²¹** An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed. 

**²²** Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee. 

**²³** Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good. 

**²⁴** A man’s goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way? 

**²⁵** It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, And after vows to make inquiry. 

**²⁶** A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the threshing-wheel over them. 

**²⁷** The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts. 

**²⁸** Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness. 

**²⁹** The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head. 

**³⁰** Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes reach the innermost parts.
