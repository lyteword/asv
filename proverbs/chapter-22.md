# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, And loving favor rather than silver and gold. 

<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor meet together: Jehovah is the maker of them all. 

<sup>3</sup> A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

<sup>4</sup> The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah Is riches, and honor, and life. 

<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse: He that keepeth his soul shall be far from them. 

<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go, And even when he is old he will not depart from it. 

<sup>7</sup> The rich ruleth over the poor; And the borrower is servant to the lender. 

<sup>8</sup> He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity; And the rod of his wrath shall fail. 

<sup>9</sup> He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; For he giveth of his bread to the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out; Yea, strife and ignominy will cease. 

<sup>11</sup> He that loveth pureness of heart, For the grace of his lips the king will be his friend. 

<sup>12</sup> The eyes of Jehovah preserve him that hath knowledge; But he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man. 

<sup>13</sup> The sluggard saith, There is a lion without; I shall be slain in the streets. 

<sup>14</sup> The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; He that is abhorred of Jehovah shall fall therein. 

<sup>15</sup> Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 

<sup>16</sup> He that oppresseth the poor to increase his gain, And he that giveth to the rich, shall come only to want. 

<sup>17</sup> Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply thy heart unto my knowledge. 

<sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee, If they be established together upon thy lips. 

<sup>19</sup> That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee. 

<sup>20</sup> Have not I written unto thee excellent things Of counsels and knowledge, 

<sup>21</sup> To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee? 

<sup>22</sup> Rob not the poor, because he is poor; Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 

<sup>23</sup> For Jehovah will plead their cause, And despoil of life those that despoil them. 

<sup>24</sup> Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger; And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go: 

<sup>25</sup> Lest thou learn his ways, And get a snare to thy soul. 

<sup>26</sup> Be thou not one of them that strike hands, Or of them that are sureties for debts. 

<sup>27</sup> If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 

<sup>28</sup> Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set. 

<sup>29</sup> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; He shall not stand before mean men.
