# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will. 

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. 

<sup>4</sup> A high look, and a proud heart, Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want. 

<sup>6</sup> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death. 

<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice. 

<sup>8</sup> The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house. 

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard. 

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath. 

<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>16</sup> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead. 

<sup>17</sup> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman. 

<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up. 

<sup>21</sup> He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor. 

<sup>22</sup> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He worketh in the arrogance of pride. 

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard killeth him; For his hands refuse to labor. 

<sup>26</sup> There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. 

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! 

<sup>28</sup> A false witness shall perish; But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure. 

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways. 

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Jehovah. 

<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Jehovah.
