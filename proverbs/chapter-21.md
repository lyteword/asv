# Chapter 21

**¹** The king’s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will. 

**²** Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the hearts. 

**³** To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. 

**⁴** A high look, and a proud heart, Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 

**⁵** The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want. 

**⁶** The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death. 

**⁷** The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice. 

**⁸** The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right. 

**⁹** It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house. 

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. 

**¹¹** When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

**¹²** The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin. 

**¹³** Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard. 

**¹⁴** A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath. 

**¹⁵** It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁶** The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead. 

**¹⁷** He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

**¹⁸** The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright. 

**¹⁹** It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman. 

**²⁰** There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up. 

**²¹** He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor. 

**²²** A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

**²³** Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles. 

**²⁴** The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He worketh in the arrogance of pride. 

**²⁵** The desire of the sluggard killeth him; For his hands refuse to labor. 

**²⁶** There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. 

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! 

**²⁸** A false witness shall perish; But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure. 

**²⁹** A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways. 

**³⁰** There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Jehovah. 

**³¹** The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Jehovah.
