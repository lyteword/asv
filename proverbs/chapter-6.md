# Chapter 6

**¹** My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger; 

**²** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

**³** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor; 

**⁴** Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids; 

**⁵** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

**⁶** Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise: 

**⁷** Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler, 

**⁸** Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest. 

**⁹** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 

**¹⁰** Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep: 

**¹¹** So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man. 

**¹²** A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth; 

**¹³** That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers; 

**¹⁴** In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord. 

**¹⁵** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy. 

**¹⁶** There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him: 

**¹⁷** Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood; 

**¹⁸** A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief, 

**¹⁹** A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren. 

**²⁰** My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother: 

**²¹** Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck. 

**²²** When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

**²³** For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 

**²⁴** To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue. 

**²⁵** Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

**²⁶** For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. 

**²⁷** Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? 

**²⁸** Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched? 

**²⁹** So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished. 

**³⁰** Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry: 

**³¹** But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house. 

**³²** He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul. 

**³³** Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

**³⁴** For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

**³⁵** He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
