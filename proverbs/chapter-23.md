# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee; 

<sup>2</sup> And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite. 

<sup>3</sup> Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food. 

<sup>4</sup> Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom. 

<sup>5</sup> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven. 

<sup>6</sup> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties: 

<sup>7</sup> For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. 

<sup>8</sup> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words. 

<sup>9</sup> Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 

<sup>10</sup> Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 

<sup>11</sup> For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee. 

<sup>12</sup> Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> Withhold not correction from the child; For if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol. 

<sup>15</sup> My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine: 

<sup>16</sup> Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things. 

<sup>17</sup> Let not thy heart envy sinners; But be thou in the fear of Jehovah all the day long: 

<sup>18</sup> For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off. 

<sup>19</sup> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way. 

<sup>20</sup> Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh: 

<sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. 

<sup>22</sup> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old. 

<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and sell it not; Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 

<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him. 

<sup>25</sup> Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice. 

<sup>26</sup> My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways. 

<sup>27</sup> For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit. 

<sup>28</sup> Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men. 

<sup>29</sup> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? 

<sup>30</sup> They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine. 

<sup>31</sup> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly: 

<sup>32</sup> At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder. 

<sup>33</sup> Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things. 

<sup>34</sup> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 

<sup>35</sup> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
