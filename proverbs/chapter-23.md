# Chapter 23

**¹** When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee; 

**²** And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite. 

**³** Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food. 

**⁴** Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom. 

**⁵** Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven. 

**⁶** Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties: 

**⁷** For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. 

**⁸** The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words. 

**⁹** Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 

**¹⁰** Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 

**¹¹** For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee. 

**¹²** Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. 

**¹³** Withhold not correction from the child; For if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die. 

**¹⁴** Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol. 

**¹⁵** My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine: 

**¹⁶** Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things. 

**¹⁷** Let not thy heart envy sinners; But be thou in the fear of Jehovah all the day long: 

**¹⁸** For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off. 

**¹⁹** Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way. 

**²⁰** Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh: 

**²¹** For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. 

**²²** Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old. 

**²³** Buy the truth, and sell it not; Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 

**²⁴** The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him. 

**²⁵** Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice. 

**²⁶** My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways. 

**²⁷** For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit. 

**²⁸** Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men. 

**²⁹** Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? 

**³⁰** They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine. 

**³¹** Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly: 

**³²** At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder. 

**³³** Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things. 

**³⁴** Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 

**³⁵** They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
