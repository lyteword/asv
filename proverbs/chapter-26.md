# Proverbs 26 

**¹** As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not seemly for a fool. 

**²** As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, So the curse that is causeless alighteth not. 

**³** A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of fools. 

**⁴** Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also be like unto him. 

**⁵** Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own conceit. 

**⁶** He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh in damage. 

**⁷** The legs of the lame hang loose; So is a parable in the mouth of fools. 

**⁸** As one that bindeth a stone in a sling, So is he that giveth honor to a fool. 

**⁹** As a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools. 

**¹⁰** As an archer that woundeth all, So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by. 

**¹¹** As a dog that returneth to his vomit, So is a fool that repeateth his folly. 

**¹²** Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. 

**¹³** The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way; A lion is in the streets. 

**¹⁴** As the door turneth upon its hinges, So doth the sluggard upon his bed. 

**¹⁵** The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth. 

**¹⁶** The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men that can render a reason. 

**¹⁷** He that passeth by, and vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him, Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 

**¹⁸** As a madman who casteth firebrands, Arrows, and death, 

**¹⁹** So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, And saith, Am not I in sport? 

**²⁰** For lack of wood the fire goeth out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth. 

**²¹** As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife. 

**²²** The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. 

**²³** Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross. 

**²⁴** He that hateth dissembleth with his lips; But he layeth up deceit within him: 

**²⁵** When he speaketh fair, believe him not; For there are seven abominations in his heart: 

**²⁶** Though his hatred cover itself with guile, His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly. 

**²⁷** Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him. 

**²⁸** A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded; And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
