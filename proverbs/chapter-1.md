# Proverbs 1 

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 

**²** To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding; 

**³** To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity; 

**⁴** To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion: 

**⁵** That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels: 

**⁶** To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 

**⁷** The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 

**⁸** My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother: 

**⁹** For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck. 

**¹⁰** My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not. 

**¹¹** If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause; 

**¹²** Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit; 

**¹³** We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil; 

**¹⁴** Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse: 

**¹⁵** My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path: 

**¹⁶** For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood. 

**¹⁷** For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird: 

**¹⁸** And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives. 

**¹⁹** So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 

**²⁰** Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places; 

**²¹** She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words: 

**²²** How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge? 

**²³** Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you. 

**²⁴** Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded; 

**²⁵** But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof: 

**²⁶** I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 

**²⁷** When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you. 

**²⁸** Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me: 

**²⁹** For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah, 

**³⁰** They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof. 

**³¹** Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices. 

**³²** For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them. 

**³³** But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
