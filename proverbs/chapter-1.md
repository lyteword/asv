# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding; 

<sup>3</sup> To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity; 

<sup>4</sup> To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion: 

<sup>5</sup> That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels: 

<sup>6</sup> To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 

<sup>7</sup> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 

<sup>8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother: 

<sup>9</sup> For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck. 

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not. 

<sup>11</sup> If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause; 

<sup>12</sup> Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit; 

<sup>13</sup> We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil; 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse: 

<sup>15</sup> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path: 

<sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood. 

<sup>17</sup> For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird: 

<sup>18</sup> And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives. 

<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places; 

<sup>21</sup> She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words: 

<sup>22</sup> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge? 

<sup>23</sup> Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you. 

<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded; 

<sup>25</sup> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof: 

<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 

<sup>27</sup> When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you. 

<sup>28</sup> Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me: 

<sup>29</sup> For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah, 

<sup>30</sup> They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof. 

<sup>31</sup> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices. 

<sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them. 

<sup>33</sup> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
