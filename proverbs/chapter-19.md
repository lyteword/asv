# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. 

<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth them with words, but they are gone. 

<sup>8</sup> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 

<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 

<sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah. 

<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that is careless of his ways shall die. 

<sup>17</sup> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again. 

<sup>18</sup> Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; And set not thy heart on his destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again. 

<sup>20</sup> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

<sup>21</sup> There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand. 

<sup>22</sup> That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil. 

<sup>24</sup> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear instruction Only to err from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.
