# Proverbs 9 

**¹** Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars: 

**²** She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table: 

**³** She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city: 

**⁴** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

**⁵** Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled. 

**⁶** Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding. 

**⁷** He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot. 

**⁸** Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. 

**⁹** Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 

**¹⁰** The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

**¹¹** For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased. 

**¹²** If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it. 

**¹³** The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing. 

**¹⁴** And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city, 

**¹⁵** To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways: 

**¹⁶** Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, 

**¹⁷** Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 

**¹⁸** But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
