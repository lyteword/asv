# Chapter 16

**¹** The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. 

**²** All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits. 

**³** Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established. 

**⁴** Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

**⁵** Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 

**⁶** By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil. 

**⁷** When a man’s ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

**⁸** Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice. 

**⁹** A man’s heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps. 

**¹⁰** A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment. 

**¹¹** A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s; All the weights of the bag are his work. 

**¹²** It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness. 

**¹³** Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right. 

**¹⁴** The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it. 

**¹⁵** In the light of the king’s countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. 

**¹⁶** How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. 

**¹⁷** The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 

**¹⁸** Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. 

**¹⁹** Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

**²⁰** He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he. 

**²¹** The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 

**²²** Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is their folly. 

**²³** The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips. 

**²⁴** Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

**²⁵** There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death. 

**²⁶** The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him thereto. 

**²⁷** A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire. 

**²⁸** A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends. 

**²⁹** A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good. 

**³⁰** He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. 

**³¹** The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness. 

**³²** He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. 

**³³** The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.
