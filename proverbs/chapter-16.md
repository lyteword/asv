# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. 

<sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits. 

<sup>3</sup> Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established. 

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil. 

<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice. 

<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps. 

<sup>10</sup> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment. 

<sup>11</sup> A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s; All the weights of the bag are his work. 

<sup>12</sup> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right. 

<sup>14</sup> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it. 

<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king’s countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. 

<sup>16</sup> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. 

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

<sup>20</sup> He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he. 

<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 

<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is their folly. 

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

<sup>25</sup> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death. 

<sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him thereto. 

<sup>27</sup> A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire. 

<sup>28</sup> A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends. 

<sup>29</sup> A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good. 

<sup>30</sup> He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. 

<sup>31</sup> The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness. 

<sup>32</sup> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. 

<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.
