# Chapter 11

**¹** A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight. 

**²** When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom. 

**³** The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. 

**⁴** Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death. 

**⁵** The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 

**⁶** The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity. 

**⁷** When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth. 

**⁸** The righteous is delivered out of trouble; And the wicked cometh in his stead. 

**⁹** With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered. 

**¹⁰** When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 

**¹¹** By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 

**¹²** He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 

**¹³** He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. 

**¹⁴** Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. 

**¹⁵** He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure. 

**¹⁶** A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches. 

**¹⁷** The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. 

**¹⁸** The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward. 

**¹⁹** He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life; And he that pursueth evil doeth it to his own death. 

**²⁰** They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in their way are his delight. 

**²¹** Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. 

**²²** As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, So is a fair woman that is without discretion. 

**²³** The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 

**²⁴** There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want. 

**²⁵** The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself. 

**²⁶** He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. 

**²⁷** He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him. 

**²⁸** He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. 

**²⁹** He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. 

**³⁰** The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls. 

**³¹** Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; How much more the wicked and the sinner!
