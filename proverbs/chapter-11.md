# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight. 

<sup>2</sup> When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom. 

<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. 

<sup>4</sup> Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death. 

<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity. 

<sup>7</sup> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth. 

<sup>8</sup> The righteous is delivered out of trouble; And the wicked cometh in his stead. 

<sup>9</sup> With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered. 

<sup>10</sup> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 

<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 

<sup>13</sup> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. 

<sup>14</sup> Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. 

<sup>15</sup> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure. 

<sup>16</sup> A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches. 

<sup>17</sup> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward. 

<sup>19</sup> He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life; And he that pursueth evil doeth it to his own death. 

<sup>20</sup> They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in their way are his delight. 

<sup>21</sup> Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. 

<sup>22</sup> As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout, So is a fair woman that is without discretion. 

<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 

<sup>24</sup> There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want. 

<sup>25</sup> The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself. 

<sup>26</sup> He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. 

<sup>27</sup> He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him. 

<sup>28</sup> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. 

<sup>29</sup> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. 

<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls. 

<sup>31</sup> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; How much more the wicked and the sinner!
