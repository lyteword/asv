# Proverbs 10 

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. 

**²** Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death. 

**³** Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. 

**⁴** He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 

**⁵** He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 

**⁶** Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**⁷** The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot. 

**⁸** The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall. 

**⁹** He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 

**¹⁰** He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall. 

**¹¹** The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**¹²** Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions. 

**¹³** In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. 

**¹⁴** Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. 

**¹⁵** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty. 

**¹⁶** The labor of the righteous tendeth to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin. 

**¹⁷** He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth. 

**¹⁸** He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool. 

**¹⁹** In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. 

**²⁰** The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth. 

**²¹** The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding. 

**²²** The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith. 

**²³** It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And so is wisdom to a man of understanding. 

**²⁴** The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 

**²⁵** When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 

**²⁶** As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him. 

**²⁷** The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 

**²⁸** The hope of the righteous shall be gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish. 

**²⁹** The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

**³⁰** The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land. 

**³¹** The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off. 

**³²** The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.
