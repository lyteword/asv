# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Boast not thyself of to-morrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 

<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips. 

<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both. 

<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy? 

<sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden. 

<sup>6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse. 

<sup>7</sup> The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 

<sup>8</sup> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place. 

<sup>9</sup> Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel. 

<sup>10</sup> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; And go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that reproacheth me. 

<sup>12</sup> A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

<sup>13</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman. 

<sup>14</sup> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him. 

<sup>15</sup> A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike: 

<sup>16</sup> He that would restrain her restraineth the wind; And his right hand encountereth oil. 

<sup>17</sup> Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 

<sup>18</sup> Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that regardeth his master shall be honored. 

<sup>19</sup> As in water face answereth to face, So the heart of man to man. 

<sup>20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied. 

<sup>21</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is tried by his praise. 

<sup>22</sup> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him. 

<sup>23</sup> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, And look well to thy herds: 

<sup>24</sup> For riches are not for ever; And doth the crown endure unto all generations? 

<sup>25</sup> The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in. 

<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for thy clothing, And the goats are the price of the field; 

<sup>27</sup> And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, And maintenance for thy maidens.
