# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye. 

<sup>3</sup> Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart. 

<sup>4</sup> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding thy kinswoman: 

<sup>5</sup> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words. 

<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice; 

<sup>7</sup> And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding, 

<sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house, 

<sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness. 

<sup>10</sup> And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. 

<sup>11</sup> (She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house: 

<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.) 

<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him: 

<sup>14</sup> Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. 

<sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. 

<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves. 

<sup>19</sup> For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey: 

<sup>20</sup> He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon. 

<sup>21</sup> With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along. 

<sup>22</sup> He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool; 

<sup>23</sup> Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life. 

<sup>24</sup> Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths. 

<sup>26</sup> For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host. 

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.
