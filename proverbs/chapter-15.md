# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> A soft answer turneth away wrath; But a grievous word stirreth up anger. 

<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out folly. 

<sup>3</sup> The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good. 

<sup>4</sup> A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> A fool despiseth his fatherâ€™s correction; But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence. 

<sup>6</sup> In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 

<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish doeth not so. 

<sup>8</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But the prayer of the upright is his delight. 

<sup>9</sup> The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; And he that hateth reproof shall die. 

<sup>11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah; How much more then the hearts of the children of men! 

<sup>12</sup> A scoffer loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise. 

<sup>13</sup> A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken. 

<sup>14</sup> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly. 

<sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah, Than great treasure and trouble therewith. 

<sup>17</sup> Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. 

<sup>18</sup> A wrathful man stirreth up contention; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway. 

<sup>20</sup> A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother. 

<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding maketh straight his going. 

<sup>22</sup> Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established. 

<sup>23</sup> A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it! 

<sup>24</sup> To the wise the way of life goeth upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath. 

<sup>25</sup> Jehovah will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow. 

<sup>26</sup> Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah; But pleasant words are pure. 

<sup>27</sup> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth bribes shall live. 

<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. 

<sup>29</sup> Jehovah is far from the wicked; But he heareth the prayer of the righteous. 

<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; And good tidings make the bones fat. 

<sup>31</sup> The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall abide among the wise. 

<sup>32</sup> He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding. 

<sup>33</sup> The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor goeth humility.
