# Proverbs 13 

**¹** A wise son heareth his father’s instruction; But a scoffer heareth not rebuke. 

**²** A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth; But the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence. 

**³** He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life; But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. 

**⁴** The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. 

**⁵** A righteous man hateth lying; But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. 

**⁶** Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 

**⁷** There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth. 

**⁸** The ransom of a man’s life is his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening. 

**⁹** The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 

**¹⁰** By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom. 

**¹¹** Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth by labor shall have increase. 

**¹²** Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. 

**¹³** Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 

**¹⁴** The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. 

**¹⁵** Good understanding giveth favor; But the way of the transgressor is hard. 

**¹⁶** Every prudent man worketh with knowledge; But a fool flaunteth his folly. 

**¹⁷** A wicked messenger falleth into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health. 

**¹⁸** Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth correction; But he that regardeth reproof shall be honored. 

**¹⁹** The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. 

**²⁰** Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise; But the companion of fools shall smart for it. 

**²¹** Evil pursueth sinners; But the righteous shall be recompensed with good. 

**²²** A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous. 

**²³** Much food is in the tillage of the poor; But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice. 

**²⁴** He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. 

**²⁵** The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked shall want.
