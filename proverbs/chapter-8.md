# Chapter 8

**¹** Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice? 

**²** On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth; 

**³** Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud: 

**⁴** Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men. 

**⁵** O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart. 

**⁶** Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things. 

**⁷** For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

**⁸** All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. 

**⁹** They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge. 

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold. 

**¹¹** For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it. 

**¹²** I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion. 

**¹³** The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate. 

**¹⁴** Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might. 

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, And princes decree justice. 

**¹⁶** By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 

**¹⁷** I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me. 

**¹⁸** Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness. 

**¹⁹** My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver. 

**²⁰** I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice; 

**²¹** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries. 

**²²** Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old. 

**²³** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was. 

**²⁴** When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water. 

**²⁵** Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth; 

**²⁶** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world. 

**²⁷** When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep, 

**²⁸** When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong, 

**²⁹** When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth; 

**³⁰** Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him, 

**³¹** Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men. 

**³²** Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways. 

**³³** Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not. 

**³⁴** Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors. 

**³⁵** For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah. 

**³⁶** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.
