# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice? 

<sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth; 

<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud: 

<sup>4</sup> Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things. 

<sup>7</sup> For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. 

<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold. 

<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it. 

<sup>12</sup> I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate. 

<sup>14</sup> Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might. 

<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, And princes decree justice. 

<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me. 

<sup>18</sup> Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice; 

<sup>21</sup> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries. 

<sup>22</sup> Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old. 

<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was. 

<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water. 

<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth; 

<sup>26</sup> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world. 

<sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep, 

<sup>28</sup> When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong, 

<sup>29</sup> When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth; 

<sup>30</sup> Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him, 

<sup>31</sup> Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not. 

<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors. 

<sup>35</sup> For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah. 

<sup>36</sup> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.
