# Chapter 3

**¹** My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments: 

**²** For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee. 

**³** Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart: 

**⁴** So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man. 

**⁵** Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding: 

**⁶** In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths. 

**⁷** Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil: 

**⁸** It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones. 

**⁹** Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase: 

**¹⁰** So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine. 

**¹¹** My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof: 

**¹²** For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 

**¹³** Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding. 

**¹⁴** For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold. 

**¹⁵** She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her. 

**¹⁶** Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor. 

**¹⁷** Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace. 

**¹⁸** She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her. 

**¹⁹** Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens. 

**²⁰** By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew. 

**²¹** My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion: 

**²²** So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck. 

**²³** Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble. 

**²⁴** When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 

**²⁵** Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh: 

**²⁶** For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken. 

**²⁷** Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it. 

**²⁸** Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee. 

**²⁹** Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 

**³⁰** Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm. 

**³¹** Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways. 

**³²** For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright. 

**³³** The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 

**³⁴** Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly. 

**³⁵** The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
