# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments: 

<sup>2</sup> For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart: 

<sup>4</sup> So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man. 

<sup>5</sup> Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding: 

<sup>6</sup> In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil: 

<sup>8</sup> It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones. 

<sup>9</sup> Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase: 

<sup>10</sup> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof: 

<sup>12</sup> For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold. 

<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her. 

<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor. 

<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace. 

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her. 

<sup>19</sup> Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens. 

<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion: 

<sup>22</sup> So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck. 

<sup>23</sup> Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble. 

<sup>24</sup> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 

<sup>25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh: 

<sup>26</sup> For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken. 

<sup>27</sup> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it. 

<sup>28</sup> Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee. 

<sup>29</sup> Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 

<sup>30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm. 

<sup>31</sup> Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways. 

<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 

<sup>34</sup> Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly. 

<sup>35</sup> The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
