# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin? 

<sup>2</sup> For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high? 

<sup>3</sup> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit 

<sup>6</sup> (Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity); 

<sup>7</sup> If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands: 

<sup>8</sup> Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door; 

<sup>10</sup> Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her. 

<sup>11</sup> For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: 

<sup>12</sup> For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase. 

<sup>13</sup> If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me; 

<sup>14</sup> What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 

<sup>15</sup> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

<sup>17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof 

<sup>18</sup> (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother’s womb); 

<sup>19</sup> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering; 

<sup>20</sup> If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

<sup>21</sup> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate: 

<sup>22</sup> Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone. 

<sup>23</sup> For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing. 

<sup>24</sup> If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 

<sup>25</sup> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much; 

<sup>26</sup> If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness, 

<sup>27</sup> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand: 

<sup>28</sup> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above. 

<sup>29</sup> If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him 

<sup>30</sup> (Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse); 

<sup>31</sup> If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat? 

<sup>32</sup> (The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller); 

<sup>33</sup> If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom, 

<sup>34</sup> Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door— 

<sup>35</sup> Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me) And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written! 

<sup>36</sup> Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown: 

<sup>37</sup> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him. 

<sup>38</sup> If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together; 

<sup>39</sup> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 

<sup>40</sup> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
