# Chapter 11

**¹** Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

**²** Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified? 

**³** Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 

**⁴** For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes. 

**⁵** But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee, 

**⁶** And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. 

**⁷** Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 

**⁸** It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know? 

**⁹** The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea. 

**¹⁰** If he pass through, and shut up, And call unto judgment, then who can hinder him? 

**¹¹** For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not. 

**¹²** But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born as a wild ass’s colt. 

**¹³** If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him; 

**¹⁴** If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents. 

**¹⁵** Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 

**¹⁶** For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away, 

**¹⁷** And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. 

**¹⁸** And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety. 

**¹⁹** Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

**²⁰** But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
