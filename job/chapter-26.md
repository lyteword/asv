# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength! 

<sup>3</sup> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge! 

<sup>4</sup> To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee? 

<sup>5</sup> They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof. 

<sup>6</sup> Sheol is naked before God, And Abaddon hath no covering. 

<sup>7</sup> He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them. 

<sup>9</sup> He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

<sup>10</sup> He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness. 

<sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke. 

<sup>12</sup> He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab. 

<sup>13</sup> By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent. 

<sup>14</sup> Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?
