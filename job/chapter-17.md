# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation. 

<sup>3</sup> Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me? 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them. 

<sup>5</sup> He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail. 

<sup>6</sup> But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow. 

<sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> They change the night into day: The light, say they, is near unto the darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness; 

<sup>14</sup> If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister; 

<sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it? 

<sup>16</sup> It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.
