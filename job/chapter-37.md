# Chapter 37

**¹** Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place. 

**²** Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 

**³** He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 

**⁴** After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard. 

**⁵** God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. 

**⁶** For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain. 

**⁷** He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know it. 

**⁸** Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens. 

**⁹** Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm, And cold out of the north. 

**¹⁰** By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened. 

**¹¹** Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning: 

**¹²** And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world, 

**¹³** Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come. 

**¹⁴** Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 

**¹⁵** Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine? 

**¹⁶** Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 

**¹⁷** How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind? 

**¹⁸** Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror? 

**¹⁹** Teach us what we shall say unto him; For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness. 

**²⁰** Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 

**²¹** And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them. 

**²²** Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty. 

**²³** Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict. 

**²⁴** Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
