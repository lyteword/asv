# Chapter 13

**¹** Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it. 

**²** What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. 

**³** Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God. 

**⁴** But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value. 

**⁵** Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom. 

**⁶** Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

**⁷** Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him? 

**⁸** Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God? 

**⁹** Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him? 

**¹⁰** He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show partiality. 

**¹¹** Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you? 

**¹²** Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay. 

**¹³** Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will. 

**¹⁴** Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand? 

**¹⁵** Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him. 

**¹⁶** This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him. 

**¹⁷** Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears. 

**¹⁸** Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous. 

**¹⁹** Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost. 

**²⁰** Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face: 

**²¹** Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid. 

**²²** Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

**²³** How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin. 

**²⁴** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy? 

**²⁵** Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

**²⁶** For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth: 

**²⁷** Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet: 

**²⁸** Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
