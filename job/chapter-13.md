# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it. 

<sup>2</sup> What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God. 

<sup>4</sup> But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him? 

<sup>8</sup> Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God? 

<sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him? 

<sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show partiality. 

<sup>11</sup> Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you? 

<sup>12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay. 

<sup>13</sup> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will. 

<sup>14</sup> Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand? 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him. 

<sup>16</sup> This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him. 

<sup>17</sup> Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears. 

<sup>18</sup> Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous. 

<sup>19</sup> Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost. 

<sup>20</sup> Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face: 

<sup>21</sup> Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

<sup>23</sup> How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin. 

<sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy? 

<sup>25</sup> Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

<sup>26</sup> For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth: 

<sup>27</sup> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet: 

<sup>28</sup> Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
