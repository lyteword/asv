# Job 9 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God? 

**³** If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand. 

**⁴** He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?— 

**⁵** Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger; 

**⁶** That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble; 

**⁷** That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars; 

**⁸** That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea; 

**⁹** That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; 

**¹⁰** That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number. 

**¹¹** Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 

**¹²** Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou? 

**¹³** God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him. 

**¹⁴** How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words to reason with him? 

**¹⁵** Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge. 

**¹⁶** If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice. 

**¹⁷** For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause. 

**¹⁸** He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness. 

**¹⁹** If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty! And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me? 

**²⁰** Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse. 

**²¹** I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life. 

**²²** It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

**²³** If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent. 

**²⁴** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If it be not he, who then is it? 

**²⁵** Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good. 

**²⁶** They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey. 

**²⁷** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer; 

**²⁸** I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 

**²⁹** I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain? 

**³⁰** If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean; 

**³¹** Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me. 

**³²** For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment. 

**³³** There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both. 

**³⁴** Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid: 

**³⁵** Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.
