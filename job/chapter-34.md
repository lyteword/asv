# Chapter 34

**¹** Moreover Elihu answered and said, 

**²** Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 

**³** For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food. 

**⁴** Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good. 

**⁵** For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right: 

**⁶** Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression. 

**⁷** What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water, 

**⁸** Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men? 

**⁹** For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God. 

**¹⁰** Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 

**¹¹** For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways. 

**¹²** Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 

**¹³** Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world? 

**¹⁴** If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 

**¹⁵** All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust. 

**¹⁶** If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words. 

**¹⁷** Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?— 

**¹⁸** Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked; 

**¹⁹** That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands. 

**²⁰** In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand. 

**²¹** For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings. 

**²²** There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

**²³** For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment. 

**²⁴** He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead. 

**²⁵** Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 

**²⁶** He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others; 

**²⁷** Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways: 

**²⁸** So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted. 

**²⁹** When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man: 

**³⁰** That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people. 

**³¹** For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: 

**³²** That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more? 

**³³** Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest. 

**³⁴** Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me: 

**³⁵** Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom. 

**³⁶** Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men. 

**³⁷** For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.
