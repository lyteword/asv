# Job 28 

**¹** Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine. 

**²** Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone. 

**³** Man setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness. 

**⁴** He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro. 

**⁵** As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. 

**⁶** The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold. 

**⁷** That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it: 

**⁸** The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby. 

**⁹** He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots. 

**¹⁰** He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing. 

**¹¹** He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 

**¹²** But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 

**¹³** Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living. 

**¹⁴** The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me. 

**¹⁵** It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 

**¹⁶** It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 

**¹⁷** Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. 

**¹⁸** No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies. 

**¹⁹** The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 

**²⁰** Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding? 

**²¹** Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens. 

**²²** Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears. 

**²³** God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof. 

**²⁴** For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven; 

**²⁵** To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure. 

**²⁶** When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder; 

**²⁷** Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out. 

**²⁸** And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.
