# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 

<sup>3</sup> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee? 

<sup>4</sup> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. 

<sup>5</sup> Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 

<sup>6</sup> Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. 

<sup>7</sup> For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. 

<sup>8</sup> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground; 

<sup>9</sup> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant. 

<sup>10</sup> But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? 

<sup>11</sup> As the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up; 

<sup>12</sup> So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep. 

<sup>13</sup> Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! 

<sup>14</sup> If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands. 

<sup>16</sup> But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin? 

<sup>17</sup> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity. 

<sup>18</sup> But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place; 

<sup>19</sup> The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. 

<sup>21</sup> His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. 

<sup>22</sup> But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth.
