# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> And Job again took up his parable, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me; 

<sup>3</sup> When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness; 

<sup>4</sup> As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent; 

<sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me; 

<sup>6</sup> When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil! 

<sup>7</sup> When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street, 

<sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood; 

<sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth; 

<sup>10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 

<sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me: 

<sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him. 

<sup>13</sup> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy. 

<sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem. 

<sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame. 

<sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out. 

<sup>17</sup> And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth. 

<sup>18</sup> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand: 

<sup>19</sup> My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch: 

<sup>20</sup> My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand. 

<sup>21</sup> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel. 

<sup>22</sup> After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them. 

<sup>23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 

<sup>24</sup> I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down. 

<sup>25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.
