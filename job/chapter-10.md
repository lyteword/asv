# Chapter 10

**¹** My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

**²** I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me. 

**³** Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 

**⁴** Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth? 

**⁵** Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man’s days, 

**⁶** That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin, 

**⁷** Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand? 

**⁸** Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. 

**⁹** Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again? 

**¹⁰** Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese? 

**¹¹** Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews. 

**¹²** Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 

**¹³** Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee: 

**¹⁴** If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 

**¹⁵** If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction. 

**¹⁶** And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me. 

**¹⁷** Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me. 

**¹⁸** Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me. 

**¹⁹** I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

**²⁰** Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 

**²¹** Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; 

**²²** The land dark as midnight, The land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.
