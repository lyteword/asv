# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. 

<sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. 

<sup>5</sup> If thou canst, answer thou me; Set thy words in order before me, stand forth. 

<sup>6</sup> Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 

<sup>9</sup> I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me: 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy; 

<sup>11</sup> He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man. 

<sup>13</sup> Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters? 

<sup>14</sup> For God speaketh once, Yea twice, though man regardeth it not. 

<sup>15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed; 

<sup>16</sup> Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction, 

<sup>17</sup> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, And hide pride from man; 

<sup>18</sup> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword. 

<sup>19</sup> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones; 

<sup>20</sup> So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food. 

<sup>21</sup> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out. 

<sup>22</sup> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers. 

<sup>23</sup> If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him; 

<sup>24</sup> Then God is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. 

<sup>25</sup> His flesh shall be fresher than a childâ€™s; He returneth to the days of his youth. 

<sup>26</sup> He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness. 

<sup>27</sup> He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not: 

<sup>28</sup> He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light. 

<sup>29</sup> Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man, 

<sup>30</sup> To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 

<sup>31</sup> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

<sup>32</sup> If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

<sup>33</sup> If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
