# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days? 

<sup>2</sup> There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them. 

<sup>3</sup> They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge. 

<sup>4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children. 

<sup>6</sup> They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 

<sup>9</sup> There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor; 

<sup>10</sup> So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves. 

<sup>11</sup> They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly. 

<sup>13</sup> These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof. 

<sup>14</sup> The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief. 

<sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face. 

<sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light. 

<sup>17</sup> For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness. 

<sup>18</sup> Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards. 

<sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: So doth Sheol those that have sinned. 

<sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree. 

<sup>21</sup> He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow. 

<sup>22</sup> Yet God preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life. 

<sup>23</sup> God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways. 

<sup>24</sup> They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain. 

<sup>25</sup> And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?
