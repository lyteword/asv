# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on Godâ€™s behalf. 

<sup>3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding. 

<sup>6</sup> He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right. 

<sup>7</sup> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted. 

<sup>8</sup> And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of affliction; 

<sup>9</sup> Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 

<sup>10</sup> He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. 

<sup>12</sup> But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them. 

<sup>14</sup> They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean. 

<sup>15</sup> He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression. 

<sup>16</sup> Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness. 

<sup>17</sup> But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee. 

<sup>18</sup> For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. 

<sup>19</sup> Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength? 

<sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place. 

<sup>21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 

<sup>22</sup> Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him? 

<sup>23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness? 

<sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung. 

<sup>25</sup> All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off. 

<sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable. 

<sup>27</sup> For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor, 

<sup>28</sup> Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly. 

<sup>29</sup> Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion? 

<sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea. 

<sup>31</sup> For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance. 

<sup>32</sup> He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. 

<sup>33</sup> The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
