# Job 36 

**¹** Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

**²** Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf. 

**³** I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

**⁴** For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 

**⁵** Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding. 

**⁶** He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right. 

**⁷** He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted. 

**⁸** And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of affliction; 

**⁹** Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 

**¹⁰** He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity. 

**¹¹** If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. 

**¹²** But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. 

**¹³** But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them. 

**¹⁴** They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean. 

**¹⁵** He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression. 

**¹⁶** Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness. 

**¹⁷** But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee. 

**¹⁸** For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. 

**¹⁹** Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength? 

**²⁰** Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place. 

**²¹** Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 

**²²** Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him? 

**²³** Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness? 

**²⁴** Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung. 

**²⁵** All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off. 

**²⁶** Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable. 

**²⁷** For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor, 

**²⁸** Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly. 

**²⁹** Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion? 

**³⁰** Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea. 

**³¹** For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance. 

**³²** He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. 

**³³** The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
