# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 

<sup>2</sup> And Job answered and said: 

<sup>3</sup> Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived. 

<sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it. 

<sup>6</sup> As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan. 

<sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning: 

<sup>10</sup> Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me? 

<sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck? 

<sup>13</sup> For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest, 

<sup>14</sup> With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves; 

<sup>15</sup> Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver: 

<sup>16</sup> Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light. 

<sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest. 

<sup>18</sup> There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster. 

<sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul; 

<sup>21</sup> Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures; 

<sup>22</sup> Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water. 

<sup>25</sup> For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me. 

<sup>26</sup> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.
