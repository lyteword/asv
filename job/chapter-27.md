# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> And Job again took up his parable, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul 

<sup>3</sup> (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils); 

<sup>4</sup> Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me. 

<sup>6</sup> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 

<sup>7</sup> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous. 

<sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul? 

<sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him? 

<sup>10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times? 

<sup>11</sup> I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain? 

<sup>13</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty: 

<sup>14</sup> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>15</sup> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation. 

<sup>16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay; 

<sup>17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver. 

<sup>18</sup> He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh. 

<sup>19</sup> He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers; He openeth his eyes, and he is not. 

<sup>20</sup> Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night. 

<sup>21</sup> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand. 

<sup>23</sup> Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.
