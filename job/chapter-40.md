# Chapter 40

**¹** Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said, 

**²** Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it. 

**³** Then Job answered Jehovah, and said, 

**⁴** Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth. 

**⁵** Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further. 

**⁶** Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

**⁷** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

**⁸** Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? 

**⁹** Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

**¹⁰** Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty. 

**¹¹** Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. 

**¹²** Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand. 

**¹³** Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place. 

**¹⁴** Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee. 

**¹⁵** Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox. 

**¹⁶** Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly. 

**¹⁷** He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

**¹⁸** His bones are as tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron. 

**¹⁹** He is the chief of the ways of God: He only that made him giveth him his sword. 

**²⁰** Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play. 

**²¹** He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen. 

**²²** The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about. 

**²³** Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth. 

**²⁴** Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
