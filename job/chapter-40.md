# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it. 

<sup>3</sup> Then Job answered Jehovah, and said, 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further. 

<sup>6</sup> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

<sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

<sup>8</sup> Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? 

<sup>9</sup> Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

<sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty. 

<sup>11</sup> Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. 

<sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand. 

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place. 

<sup>14</sup> Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox. 

<sup>16</sup> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly. 

<sup>17</sup> He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

<sup>18</sup> His bones are as tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God: He only that made him giveth him his sword. 

<sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play. 

<sup>21</sup> He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen. 

<sup>22</sup> The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about. 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth. 

<sup>24</sup> Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
