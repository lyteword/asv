# Job 35 

**¹** Moreover Elihu answered and said, 

**²** Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s, 

**³** That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? 

**⁴** I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee. 

**⁵** Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou. 

**⁶** If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 

**⁷** If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand? 

**⁸** Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man. 

**⁹** By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 

**¹⁰** But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night, 

**¹¹** Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens? 

**¹²** There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men. 

**¹³** Surely God will not hear an empty cry, Neither will the Almighty regard it. 

**¹⁴** How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! 

**¹⁵** But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance; 

**¹⁶** Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.
