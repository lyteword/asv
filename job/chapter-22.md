# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself. 

<sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 

<sup>4</sup> Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment? 

<sup>5</sup> Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities. 

<sup>6</sup> For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 

<sup>8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee, 

<sup>11</sup> Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee. 

<sup>12</sup> Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

<sup>13</sup> And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? 

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven. 

<sup>15</sup> Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden? 

<sup>16</sup> Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream, 

<sup>17</sup> Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us? 

<sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn, 

<sup>20</sup> Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed. 

<sup>21</sup> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee. 

<sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart. 

<sup>23</sup> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents. 

<sup>24</sup> And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks; 

<sup>25</sup> And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee. 

<sup>26</sup> For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

<sup>27</sup> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways. 

<sup>29</sup> When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; And the humble person he will save. 

<sup>30</sup> He will deliver even him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
