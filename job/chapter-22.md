# Chapter 22

**¹** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

**²** Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself. 

**³** Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 

**⁴** Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment? 

**⁵** Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities. 

**⁶** For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing. 

**⁷** Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 

**⁸** But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it. 

**⁹** Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

**¹⁰** Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee, 

**¹¹** Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee. 

**¹²** Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

**¹³** And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? 

**¹⁴** Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven. 

**¹⁵** Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden? 

**¹⁶** Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream, 

**¹⁷** Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us? 

**¹⁸** Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

**¹⁹** The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn, 

**²⁰** Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed. 

**²¹** Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee. 

**²²** Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart. 

**²³** If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents. 

**²⁴** And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks; 

**²⁵** And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee. 

**²⁶** For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

**²⁷** Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows. 

**²⁸** Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways. 

**²⁹** When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; And the humble person he will save. 

**³⁰** He will deliver even him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
