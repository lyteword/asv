# Chapter 6

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances! 

**³** For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash. 

**⁴** For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 

**⁵** Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

**⁶** Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

**⁷** My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me. 

**⁸** Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

**⁹** Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

**¹⁰** And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 

**¹¹** What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient? 

**¹²** Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass? 

**¹³** Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me? 

**¹⁴** To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

**¹⁵** My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away; 

**¹⁶** Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself: 

**¹⁷** What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

**¹⁸** The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish. 

**¹⁹** The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them. 

**²⁰** They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded. 

**²¹** For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid. 

**²²** Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance? 

**²³** Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors? 

**²⁴** Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

**²⁵** How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove? 

**²⁶** Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind? 

**²⁷** Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend. 

**²⁸** Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face. 

**²⁹** Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous. 

**³⁰** Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
