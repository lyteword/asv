# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

<sup>2</sup> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

<sup>3</sup> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains. 

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again. 

<sup>5</sup> Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass, 

<sup>6</sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place? 

<sup>7</sup> He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. 

<sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib? 

<sup>10</sup> Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 

<sup>11</sup> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor? 

<sup>12</sup> Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor? 

<sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; But are they the pinions and plumage of love? 

<sup>14</sup> For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust, 

<sup>15</sup> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them. 

<sup>16</sup> She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear; 

<sup>17</sup> Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider. 

<sup>19</sup> Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane? 

<sup>20</sup> Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible. 

<sup>21</sup> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men. 

<sup>22</sup> He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin. 

<sup>24</sup> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet. 

<sup>25</sup> As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

<sup>26</sup> Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, And stretcheth her wings toward the south? 

<sup>27</sup> Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high? 

<sup>28</sup> On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold. 

<sup>29</sup> From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off. 

<sup>30</sup> Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.
