# Job 39 

**¹** Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

**²** Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

**³** They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains. 

**⁴** Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again. 

**⁵** Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass, 

**⁶** Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place? 

**⁷** He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. 

**⁸** The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing. 

**⁹** Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib? 

**¹⁰** Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 

**¹¹** Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor? 

**¹²** Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor? 

**¹³** The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; But are they the pinions and plumage of love? 

**¹⁴** For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust, 

**¹⁵** And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them. 

**¹⁶** She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear; 

**¹⁷** Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

**¹⁸** What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider. 

**¹⁹** Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane? 

**²⁰** Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible. 

**²¹** He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men. 

**²²** He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword. 

**²³** The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin. 

**²⁴** He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet. 

**²⁵** As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

**²⁶** Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, And stretcheth her wings toward the south? 

**²⁷** Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high? 

**²⁸** On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold. 

**²⁹** From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off. 

**³⁰** Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.
