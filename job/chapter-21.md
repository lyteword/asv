# Chapter 21

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations. 

**³** Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on. 

**⁴** As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient? 

**⁵** Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth. 

**⁶** Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh. 

**⁷** Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power? 

**⁸** Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes. 

**⁹** Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them. 

**¹⁰** Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 

**¹¹** They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance. 

**¹²** They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 

**¹³** They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol. 

**¹⁴** And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 

**¹⁵** What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 

**¹⁶** Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

**¹⁷** How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That God distributeth sorrows in his anger? 

**¹⁸** That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away? 

**¹⁹** Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it: 

**²⁰** Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

**²¹** For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off? 

**²²** Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high? 

**²³** One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet: 

**²⁴** His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened. 

**²⁵** And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good. 

**²⁶** They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them. 

**²⁷** Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me. 

**²⁸** For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt? 

**²⁹** Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences, 

**³⁰** That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath? 

**³¹** Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done? 

**³²** Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb. 

**³³** The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him. 

**³⁴** How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?
