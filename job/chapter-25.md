# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places. 

<sup>3</sup> Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise? 

<sup>4</sup> How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight: 

<sup>6</sup> How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!
