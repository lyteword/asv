# Chapter 16

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all. 

**³** Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 

**⁴** I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you. 

**⁵** But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief. 

**⁶** Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased? 

**⁷** But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company. 

**⁸** And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face. 

**⁹** He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

**¹⁰** They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me. 

**¹¹** God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked. 

**¹²** I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark. 

**¹³** His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. 

**¹⁴** He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant. 

**¹⁵** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust. 

**¹⁶** My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 

**¹⁷** Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure. 

**¹⁸** O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place. 

**¹⁹** Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high. 

**²⁰** My friends scoff at me: But mine eye poureth out tears unto God, 

**²¹** That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor! 

**²²** For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
