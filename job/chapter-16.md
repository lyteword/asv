# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all. 

<sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 

<sup>4</sup> I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you. 

<sup>5</sup> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief. 

<sup>6</sup> Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased? 

<sup>7</sup> But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company. 

<sup>8</sup> And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me. 

<sup>11</sup> God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark. 

<sup>13</sup> His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. 

<sup>14</sup> He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant. 

<sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 

<sup>17</sup> Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure. 

<sup>18</sup> O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place. 

<sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high. 

<sup>20</sup> My friends scoff at me: But mine eye poureth out tears unto God, 

<sup>21</sup> That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor! 

<sup>22</sup> For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
