# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me. 

<sup>3</sup> I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me. 

<sup>4</sup> Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth, 

<sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment? 

<sup>6</sup> Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds; 

<sup>7</sup> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he? 

<sup>8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 

<sup>9</sup> The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him. 

<sup>10</sup> His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth. 

<sup>11</sup> His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue, 

<sup>13</sup> Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth; 

<sup>14</sup> Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him. 

<sup>15</sup> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly. 

<sup>16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps: The viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him. 

<sup>17</sup> He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter. 

<sup>18</sup> That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice. 

<sup>19</sup> For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up. 

<sup>20</sup> Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth. 

<sup>21</sup> There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure. 

<sup>22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating. 

<sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through. 

<sup>25</sup> He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him. 

<sup>26</sup> All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown by man shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent. 

<sup>27</sup> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart; His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
