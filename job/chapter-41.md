# Chapter 41

**¹** Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? 

**²** Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook? 

**³** Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee? 

**⁴** Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? 

**⁵** Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 

**⁶** Will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants? 

**⁷** Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears? 

**⁸** Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more. 

**⁹** Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 

**¹⁰** None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me? 

**¹¹** Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 

**¹²** I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. 

**¹³** Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws? 

**¹⁴** Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. 

**¹⁵** His strong scales are his pride, Shut up together as with a close seal. 

**¹⁶** One is so near to another, That no air can come between them. 

**¹⁷** They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered. 

**¹⁸** His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 

**¹⁹** Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth. 

**²⁰** Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and burning rushes. 

**²¹** His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth. 

**²²** In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him. 

**²³** The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. 

**²⁴** His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone. 

**²⁵** When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves. 

**²⁶** If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 

**²⁷** He counteth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood. 

**²⁸** The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. 

**²⁹** Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. 

**³⁰** His underparts are like sharp potsherds: He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire. 

**³¹** He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 

**³²** He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary. 

**³³** Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear. 

**³⁴** He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.
