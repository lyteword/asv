# Job 8 

**¹** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

**²** How long wilt thou speak these things? And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind? 

**³** Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness? 

**⁴** If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression; 

**⁵** If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty; 

**⁶** If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 

**⁷** And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase. 

**⁸** For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out 

**⁹** (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow); 

**¹⁰** Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart? 

**¹¹** Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water? 

**¹²** Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, It withereth before any other herb. 

**¹³** So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish: 

**¹⁴** Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider’s web. 

**¹⁵** He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure. 

**¹⁶** He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden. 

**¹⁷** His roots are wrapped about the stone-heap, He beholdeth the place of stones. 

**¹⁸** If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 

**¹⁹** Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring. 

**²⁰** Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers. 

**²¹** He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting. 

**²²** They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
