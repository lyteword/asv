# Chapter 12

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you. 

**³** But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 

**⁴** I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock. 

**⁵** In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth. 

**⁶** The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 

**⁷** But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee: 

**⁸** Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 

**⁹** Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this, 

**¹⁰** In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? 

**¹¹** Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food? 

**¹²** With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding. 

**¹³** With God is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding. 

**¹⁴** Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 

**¹⁵** Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 

**¹⁶** With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his. 

**¹⁷** He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools. 

**¹⁸** He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle. 

**¹⁹** He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty. 

**²⁰** He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders. 

**²¹** He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong. 

**²²** He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 

**²³** He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive. 

**²⁴** He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 

**²⁵** They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
