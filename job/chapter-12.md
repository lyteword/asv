# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 

<sup>4</sup> I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock. 

<sup>5</sup> In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth. 

<sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 

<sup>7</sup> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee: 

<sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this, 

<sup>10</sup> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? 

<sup>11</sup> Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food? 

<sup>12</sup> With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding. 

<sup>13</sup> With God is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his. 

<sup>17</sup> He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools. 

<sup>18</sup> He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle. 

<sup>19</sup> He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty. 

<sup>20</sup> He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders. 

<sup>21</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong. 

<sup>22</sup> He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 

<sup>23</sup> He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive. 

<sup>24</sup> He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 

<sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
