# Chapter 4

**¹** And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of Jehovah. 

**²** And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

**³** And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah. 

**⁴** And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 

**⁵** but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 

**⁶** And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 

**⁷** If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it. 

**⁸** And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 

**⁹** And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper? 

**¹⁰** And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. 

**¹¹** And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; 

**¹²** when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth. 

**¹³** And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 

**¹⁴** Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me. 

**¹⁵** And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him. 

**¹⁶** And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 

**¹⁷** And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 

**¹⁸** And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech. 

**¹⁹** And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 

**²⁰** And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. 

**²¹** And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. 

**²²** And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 

**²³** And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me: 

**²⁴** If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 

**²⁵** And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, said she, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him. 

**²⁶** And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.
